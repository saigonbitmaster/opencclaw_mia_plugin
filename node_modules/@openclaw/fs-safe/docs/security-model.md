# Security model

`fs-safe` is a library-level guardrail: a capability-style root handle for Node.js code that handles untrusted relative paths. It assumes the calling process already has whatever filesystem permissions it needs and aims to stop trivial path tricks from broadening that authority. It is not a sandbox and does not replace operating-system isolation.

The same shape exists in other languages: Go's [`os.Root` / `OpenInRoot`](https://go.dev/blog/osroot) and Rust's [`cap-std`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std) both expose a root handle whose operations refuse to escape it. `fs-safe` is the Node-side equivalent: a single `root()` capability that carries the boundary across every read, write, move, and remove, instead of leaving each call site to redo `path.resolve(...).startsWith(...)` and hope.

## Affected versions / exposure

In published releases through 0.4.7, the exported `resolveRootPath()` and
`resolveRootPathSync()` helpers validated a lexically normalized path spelling.
A caller-supplied path traversing an in-root symlink could therefore pass
validation while resolving outside the root. Version 0.5 fixes this with
component-wise alias resolution, resolving each alias before applying later
path components.

`root()` handles were **not** affected: their operations have contained this
case since `5ddca80`. Exposure is limited to consumers that call
`resolveRootPath()` or `resolveRootPathSync()` directly.

## Threat model

You hand a `root()` boundary to a piece of code that takes caller-controlled relative paths. The library defends against a caller that:

- supplies `..` traversal segments to escape the boundary
- supplies an absolute path outside a configured root, or to an API whose input
  contract is strictly relative/portable
- replaces a path component with a symlink between check and use (TOCTOU)
- replaces the destination directory with a symlink right before a write
- creates a hardlink that aliases an out-of-tree inode and asks you to read or replace it
- asks a read/open primitive to target a known unsafe device or process-fd path
- uses an NTFS alternate-stream or directory-index pathname to alias a different
  Windows filesystem object than the visible path suggests
- triggers a partial write that leaves a half-written file at the destination
- ships an archive with `..` paths, absolute paths, or symlinks pointing outside the destination

It does **not** defend against:

- a process running with permissions to write anywhere on the filesystem and choosing to ignore the library
- another process with the same UID racing to mutate the same directory between two separate `fs-safe` calls — the boundary is per-call, not per-session
- arbitrary traversal across filesystem boundaries, bind mounts, or virtual filesystems beyond the known unsafe read device paths
- container escape, TOCTOU between fork and exec of helpers, or kernel-level vulnerabilities
- semantic content checks: file types, archive payload schemas, signature verification

If you need full sandboxing, run the worker under reduced privileges (uid, container, seccomp, chroot, jail) and use `fs-safe` inside the sandbox to keep the worker honest about its own workspace.

## Defenses, by failure mode

### Path traversal and absolute paths

Every path is resolved against the canonicalized real path of the root, then checked at that boundary. On Windows, an exact-case structural Root prefix stays on the lexical fast path; a prefix accepted only by case folding must have the Root's exact directory identity and is rebased onto the trusted Root spelling before use. Alias resolution walks components before applying a later `..`, so a symlink cannot change what that parent segment means after validation. Parent traversal, an absolute spelling, or any alias whose canonical result is outside the root throws `outside-workspace`; absolute spellings that remain inside the root are accepted.

Guarded pathname APIs reject Windows `:` namespace aliases before normalization
or filesystem access. The only colon admitted in a Windows filesystem path is
the rooted ASCII drive designator (including extended-drive syntax); relative
paths admit none. This rule does not authorize device or network paths, which
retain their independent restrictions. Pure formatters, descriptor-only calls,
and `walkDirectory` (documented as a non-boundary traversal helper) are outside
this pathname-admission guarantee. Output helpers continue to sanitize an
untrusted basename, then validate the resulting path.

The low-level existing-object readers `openRootFile()` and
`openRootFileSync()` preserve their historical Windows drive-relative input:
they anchor its leading drive designator before this admission check. The raw
suffix remains unnormalized, and any additional colon is still rejected before
filesystem access.

Trusted-path standalone publication APIs retain the same drive-relative
compatibility. This includes the atomic file, text, JSON, JSON store/direct
queue writer, directory-replacement, move, and exclusive-publication helpers.
They capture the drive's current directory at publication entry and carry the
anchored spelling through their remaining checks, locks, callbacks, receipts,
publication, and cleanup. File writers preserve the raw suffix. Root-relative
APIs and caller-constructed relative directory receipts continue to reject
drive designators.

### Symlinks (read side)

`open()` and `read()` use `fs.open` with `O_NOFOLLOW` on POSIX where available. The library then `fstat`s the open fd and `realpath`s the original input, asserting the two refer to the same inode. A symlink swap that happens between resolve and open will fail at the identity check rather than silently following the new target.

Per-call `symlinks: "follow-within-root"` allows symlinks whose final target is still inside the root. The default is `"reject"`.

`symlinks: "follow-parents-within-root"` allows contained parent directory aliases
while rejecting a final symlink, including dangling links. Reads open the checked
canonical parent plus the final basename with the usual no-follow and identity
checks, so callers do not need their own parent canonicalization.

Guarded root reads compare lossless bigint identities from before open, the opened
descriptor, the input path, and the canonical target; numeric public `Stats`
receipts are not used as identity evidence. Before returning a handle or reading
bytes, one best-effort final admission fence checks the originally captured root
identity, freshly compares the policy-aware pathname with the opened descriptor,
canonicalizes and re-admits that current target inside the captured root, compares
the canonical target's exact bigint identity without following a final symlink
with the descriptor, and checks the root identity again. The two final pathname
observations remain independent even when the spellings match. Unknown Windows
device/inode values receive one re-inspection without reopening the file.
A definite mismatch or persistent unknown identity
rejects with `path-mismatch`; escaped fresh containment rejects with
`outside-workspace`. This is not an atomic kernel pathname/open primitive, so the
namespace can still change after the final observation.

Other regular-file readers, root-file adapters, and archive input staging retain
their documented descriptor/path admission. The exported unrooted
`openLocalFileSafely()` and `readLocalFileSafely()` helpers have no captured `Root`
identity and therefore do not provide the replacement-root fence. `copyIn()`
retains the admitted source identity for its checks before and after copying,
independently of its numeric metadata receipt.

The low-level `openRootFile()` adapters additionally retain the canonical root's
exact identity from before component traversal. After their existing pathname and
descriptor checks, they verify the root, freshly resolve and re-admit the consumed
pathname, compare that canonical leaf with the descriptor, and verify the root
again before returning ownership. A failed final fence closes the descriptor
without reading. The checks detect substitutions at each observation boundary;
they do not make pathname confinement atomic against a continuously racing peer.

### Symlinks (write side)

With the native binding loaded, `write()`, `create()`, and `copyIn()` use a
sibling temp file and create parents and publish the target relative to pinned
directory descriptors. Replacement uses descriptor-relative rename just like
no-replace publication, so replacing the parent pathname does not divert the
mutation.

When either `denyMutations` or an explicit `mutationSymlinks` policy applies,
the POSIX writer binds that exact policy snapshot to parent admission. An existing
parent is canonicalized and identity-matched to its retained descriptor before
the actual destination is authorized. A missing-parent walk authorizes each
prospective directory before `mkdirat`, opens it without following a newly
introduced link, and authorizes the opened object before continuing. This
prevents a contained Linux `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS)`
redirect from reusing policy approval for a different in-root subtree.
For an ordinary unchanged route, operation-local observations may carry that
admission across a direct-child creation only after exact parent and child
fences and a synchronous full-epoch validation. The resulting operation-local
token authorizes the opened child without an intervening await; stale,
redirected, incomplete, or foreign evidence returns to the full ordered
admission. An already-complete fallback parent is likewise retained only after
full target admission and a fresh exact guard fence. Native acceleration additionally requires an exclusive
direct-child mkdir result proving that this syscall created the name; a
collision, legacy helper, or malformed result performs the guarded walk but
cannot advance the receipt. That boolean is admission provenance only and does
not grant ownership for cleanup by pathname.

The opt-in `mutationSymlinks` policy applies independently of read policy.
`"reject"` rejects symlink components; `"follow-parents-within-root"` resolves
contained directory aliases and rejects final symlinks. Publication checks the
final component again after awaited staging and parent fences, immediately before
the rename or exclusive open. These are best-effort symlink checks, not an atomic
expected-entry/CAS replacement: a concurrent process can still replace the final
entry between its check and rename. Existing parent containment guarantees remain
as described below. Omitting `mutationSymlinks` preserves existing mutation behavior.

The JavaScript fallback used by `off`, by `auto` when no binding loads, and by
the explicit `renameIdentity: "verify-content-with-lock"` compatibility policy
cannot provide that guarantee because Node exposes no `mkdirat` or `renameat`.
It asserts directory identity around a pathname mutation and detects many
swaps, but detection occurs after the kernel may already have followed a new
parent symlink. A same-privilege peer with write access to the parent can
therefore cause an out-of-root side effect before the operation throws. Use
native `require` mode when concurrent hostile mutation is in scope.

The separate [retained-directory staging lifecycle](staged-file.md) keeps abort
cleanup anchored to the original directory after a parent or ancestor move.
It preserves observed substituted temporary entries and never cleans a recorded
publication. Directory anchoring is not expected-inode/CAS replacement, and
identity-check-then-unlink is not atomic conditional unlink. The guarantee
requires the temporary name to remain owned and removal to remain permitted;
application authorization and cooperative coordination remain necessary.

### Hardlink aliasing

When `hardlinks: "reject"` is set, reads stat the target and refuse if `nlink > 1`, on the conservative assumption that a hardlinked file might alias an out-of-tree inode. This is defense-in-depth: the link count check is best-effort and platform-dependent. Treat it as a tripwire, not authorization.

### TOCTOU between resolve and use

`resolve()`, `exists()`, `stat()`, and `list()` are explicitly advisory — they answer a question and return. `stat()` checks the exact selected target and parent while collecting metadata, and `list()` checks the exact selected directory around its complete batch, so detectable descendant redirection rejects before results are returned. Those checks do not preserve identity after the call. To act on a path with operation-local identity checks, use `read()`, `open()`, `write()`, `create()`, `copyIn()`, `move()`, or `remove()`. The containment table below states which opens are kernel-atomic and which remain best-effort.

A `root()` handle also remembers the canonical root directory identity. Calls fail with `path-mismatch` if that canonical pathname is replaced, including advisory inspection and walking calls, rather than following a replacement root into another tree.

### Denied mutations

`denyMutations` is an opt-in application policy for `root()` mutation methods. It blocks exact absolute paths with `paths` and whole subtrees with `prefixes`, merging root defaults with per-call entries so a call cannot clear root-level denies. POSIX pinned `write`, `create`, and `copyIn` copy the merged entries before awaiting preflight and reapply them to their admitted canonical parent, including before missing parent creation. This is not an OS permission boundary: code with access to `node:fs`, a shell, or another process with the same filesystem privileges can bypass it.

### Atomic writes

`replaceFileAtomic` writes to a sibling temp file in the destination directory, optionally `fsync`s it, optionally `fsync`s the parent directory after rename, and atomically renames over the destination. On failure mid-write, the destination is either the old contents (rename never happened) or the new contents (rename succeeded). There is no half-written intermediate state visible at the destination path unless the caller explicitly enables `copyFallbackOnPermissionError`, whose default `copyFallbackRestore: "none"` contract may leave a partial destination after a failed in-place fallback.

Within one process, async writes to the same target are queued so their temp-write/rename phases do not overlap. Cross-process writers still need an external protocol such as the sidecar lock helpers.

### Directory durability

`pinDirectory()` opens a directory without following its final component on
POSIX, verifies the descriptor against the pathname identity and canonical
path, and repeats those checks around synchronization. `ensureDurableDirectory()`
pins the nearest existing ancestor and each newly created segment before
synchronizing every new directory edge from the leaf upward.

Known Windows directory-flush limitations are returned as an explicit
`unsupported` outcome. POSIX and other I/O failures propagate from the strict
API. The separately named best-effort helpers intentionally provide no crash
durability guarantee.

### Archive extraction

`extractArchive` first stages into a private temp directory (mode 0700) outside the destination, validates each entry path against `..` and absolute prefixes, refuses link-type entries by default, enforces entry count and byte budgets, and only then merges the staged tree into the destination through the same boundary checks used by direct writes.

TAR extraction and bounded reads validate the complete decompressed raw framing
before parser normalization: directory/link sizes must be zero, EOF must contain
two consecutive zero blocks, and only zero padding may follow EOF. This rejects
hidden headers and body/header smuggling consistently across the JavaScript and
native backends. The meter checks logical member count before consuming bodies,
even for unrequested or filtered members. Per-entry/cumulative payload budgets
apply only to entries accepted after strip/filter policy, outside the raw meter.
A separate absolute decoded cap includes every member body, headers, metadata,
all padding, and EOF, closing cumulative-metadata and zero-tail bypasses. Native
extraction/read passes drain through physical EOF before publication or
returning selected bytes, even when the TAR parser stops earlier. Bounded
reads use default archive admission limits and keep `maxBytes` scoped to the
requested output. Metadata retains its per-record bound. See [archive framing](archive.md#raw-tar-framing) for supported
metadata and compression formats.

## What "library-level" means

A library cannot revoke its own caller's authority. If your code chooses to bypass `fs-safe` and call `fs.writeFile` directly with the same path, you bypass the defenses too. The contract `fs-safe` enforces is: *every filesystem operation that touches caller-controlled input goes through the boundary*. That contract is yours to keep.

The library does not modify or constrain the global Node.js `fs` namespace, and it does not patch the runtime. Other code in the same process retains its normal filesystem authority.

## Containment guarantees by platform

`openBeneath()` and JavaScript open results report one of two factual containment classes:

| Mechanism | Reported containment | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Linux native with `openat2` | `kernel-atomic` | `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS)` resolves and opens under the root in one kernel operation. |
| Linux native without `openat2` | `best-effort` | A no-follow `openat` component walk retains each parent and verifies exact identity associations before and after the final open; all symlink components are rejected. |
| macOS native | `best-effort` | macOS 15.4 and newer use `O_RESOLVE_BENEATH` first; older kernels use the guarded `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)` component walk. Both verify the opened descriptor with `F_GETPATH`. |
| Windows native | `best-effort` | Handle-relative `NtCreateFile` rejects reparse points, but this package does not claim a Linux-style atomic beneath guarantee. |
| JavaScript fallback | `best-effort` | Canonical checks, no-follow opens where Node exposes them, and post-open identity checks form a check-then-use sequence. |

The macOS `F_GETPATH` verification is an escape detector, not a race-atomic guarantee. A hostile same-UID process can rename a directory after `O_RESOLVE_BENEATH` or the manual walk and race the post-open sample or a later descriptor-relative mutation. The native result therefore remains `best-effort` on macOS even when the kernel flag is available. No policy decision is attached to these labels; callers can inspect the fact and decide what their own threat model requires.

The Linux fallback's identity checks are also detection-based: a directory can be renamed between chain samples or before a later descriptor-relative mutation. It cannot provide atomic resolution, and rejection after a mutating open does not promise rollback. See [Linux without openat2](native.md#linux-without-openat2) for the cached capability probe, conservative symlink rejection, and operations that remain unavailable.

The public `OpenResult`, `ReadResult`, and `WritableOpenResult` expose `containment`. Those root APIs currently report `best-effort`; direct native `openBeneath()` reports the platform value above. No-replace publication uses `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)` on Linux, `renameatx_np(RENAME_EXCL)` on macOS, and `FileRenameInfoEx` with replacement disabled on Windows, but those separate mutation semantics do not upgrade an open result's containment label.

## Limitations to keep in mind

| Limitation | What it means |
|---|---|
| Not ambient authority removal | Code that can import `node:fs` can still bypass the handle. Keep caller-controlled path operations behind `root()` by convention, review, and tests. |
| Absolute paths are escape hatches | APIs that accept or return absolute paths exist for audit, ingest, and advanced composition. Prefer root-relative names in normal application flow. |
| Not a mount boundary | `root()` keeps path traversal inside the directory tree and blocks known unsafe read device paths, but it does not make bind mounts or virtual filesystems safe to expose wholesale. |
| Per-call, not per-session | Another process with the same privileges can still mutate the tree between calls, and best-effort mechanisms retain documented same-call race windows. Use one verb method to minimize the window and inspect its reported containment class. |
| JavaScript mutations are detection-based | Without the native binding, Node pathname mutations retain a check-to-syscall race. A writable parent can be swapped so a create, rename, or removal affects an out-of-root path before the fallback detects identity drift. |
| Hardlink rejection is best-effort | Link-count checks depend on platform metadata. Treat `hardlinks: "reject"` as a tripwire, not an authorization primitive. |
| Mode bits are not a full policy engine | `replaceFileAtomic` and secret-file helpers set requested modes, but you should still set umask and inspect modes when policy requires it. |
| Archive extraction is path safety, not content safety | Unsafe entry paths and links are rejected; malicious payload contents remain your application layer's problem. |
| Native package unavailable | `helper-unavailable` falls back in `auto` mode and fails closed in `require` mode for native-backed operations. Guarded JavaScript atomicity and identity checks remain. |
| FUSE mounts with rename-unstable inode numbers | Some FUSE mounts (rclone is a confirmed example) do not preserve source inode identity at the rename destination. The explicit `renameIdentity: "verify-content-with-lock"` compatibility mode verifies content under a cooperative lock for that boundary only; subsequent path identity checks and the default remain strict. See [Writing](writing.md) for the weaker opt-in contract. |

## Recommended deployment shape

- Run worker code under a dedicated UID with the smallest filesystem privileges that still allow the worker to do its job.
- Mount the workspace directory writable; mount everything else read-only or not at all.
- Use `fs-safe`'s `root()` for that workspace.
- For credentials, use [secret files](secret-file.md) (mode 0600 in mode-0700 dirs) rather than the workspace.
- For scratch space, use a [private temp workspace](temp.md) — don't reuse the workspace root.
