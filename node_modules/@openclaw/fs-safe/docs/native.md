# Native architecture

`@openclaw/fs-safe` uses native bindings that supply mechanisms Node does
not expose directly. The Rust layer is deliberately not a second policy engine.
TypeScript owns trusted-root selection, path validation, archive filtering,
budgets, modes, identity fencing, cleanup decisions, and error normalization.
Rust receives already-decided relative operations and performs the smallest
platform syscall sequence that can preserve the boundary.

Every operation that has an equivalent safe Node implementation keeps that
guarded JavaScript path. Native loading is lazy; installs do not compile Rust,
run postinstall code, or fetch binaries at runtime. Seven exact-version optional
packages are filtered by OS, CPU, and Linux libc, so an installation receives
only its matching prebuilt binding.
Native-only formats fail explicitly
instead of substituting a weaker implementation.

## The beneath model

A trusted directory descriptor is the capability. Native operations accept
that descriptor plus a validated relative path and never reconstruct authority
from a process working directory. Newly created files use exclusive creation,
and TypeScript compares descriptor, pathname, and expected identities before
accepting results.

Conceptually, a caller grants authority to an already-open root—not to a path
string that can be reinterpreted later:

```text
validated Root handle
  └─ relative components (untrusted)
       └─ open/link/mkdir beneath the handle
            └─ compare descriptor + pathname + expected identity
```

The TypeScript layer validates and decides. The native layer never decides
whether a path, archive entry, mode, owner, or cleanup policy is acceptable.

- Linux uses `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS)`, fd-relative
  `mkdirat`/`linkat`/`renameat`/`renameat2`, `FICLONE`, and `copy_file_range`.
  Without `openat2`, beneath opens use the [guarded fallback](#linux-without-openat2).
- macOS 15.4 and newer first use `openat(O_RESOLVE_BENEATH)`; older kernels walk
  components with `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)` and restart in-root symlinks from the
  pinned root. Both routes apply an `F_GETPATH` post-open containment detector,
  but directory rename races mean the result remains `best-effort`, not
  race-atomic. macOS uses `renameatx_np(RENAME_EXCL)` and permits
  `fclonefileat` in an owned, non-shared parent. The clone is normalized inside
  a private staging directory: flags, ACLs, extended attributes, and broad mode
  bits are cleared before no-replace publication. Clone admission obtains mode,
  owner, exact identity, flags, and ACL state together from the retained descriptor;
  immutable receipts are compared across the private staging operation and against
  fresh no-follow pathname identity reads. Any extended entry on the target parent
  or private staging directory is rejected before cloning bytes. The payload's
  cleared ACL and normalized descriptor facts are verified before publication and
  again, with a fresh published-name identity fence, before its descriptor is
  returned. Unsupported admission before payload
  creation or an unsupported clone syscall may still select the documented
  ordinary-copy path. After the clone creates bytes, normalization and security
  verification failures report terminal `EIO`, retaining the original error
  detail; successful cleanup does not make them eligible for ordinary-copy retry.
  Cleanup failures remain secondary diagnostics, and already-terminal publication
  errors such as `EEXIST` retain their status.
- Windows uses handle-relative `NtCreateFile` with `OBJ_DONT_REPARSE` and
  `FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`, then explicitly rejects reparse points. Rename and
  hardlink operations stay rooted in already-open handles. Owner/DACL reads
  use `GetSecurityInfo`; private directories receive their protected DACL in
  an exclusive, handle-relative `NtCreateFile` call. Their created handles remain
  open through ACL and pathname-association checks and own any failure cleanup.
  N-API descriptors cross into and out of
  this layer only through the host executable's paired libuv descriptor bridge;
  missing or partial exports fail with `ENOTSUP` instead of trying a raw HANDLE
  or add-on CRT descriptor namespace.

The internal macOS `inspectDarwinAcl(fd)` capability reports `absent`, `empty`,
or `present` for the opened object's extended ACL. It synchronously borrows the
caller's descriptor, preserving its file position and POSIX record locks, and
never reopens a pathname. Keep the descriptor open until inspection returns.
Darwin's `acl_get_entry` returns
zero for an entry; end-of-list is accepted only for the first entry of a valid,
privately owned empty ACL. Unsupported, malformed, and failed inspection is not
reported as absence. These facts do not classify individual ACE permissions or
prove volume ownership enforcement; each caller applies its own security policy.

## Linux without openat2

Linux kernels before 5.6 and containers whose seccomp policy denies `openat2`
can keep native mode `auto` or `require`. The addon caches one harmless
`openat2(".")` capability probe per process. `ENOSYS`, or `EPERM` on that probe,
selects the native `openat` fallback. An `EPERM`/`EACCES` from an application
operation is still a permission error and never triggers a retry. Install
syscall filters before the first native operation; a later `ENOSYS` fails with
`ENOTSUP`, rather than changing the cached mechanism during a call.

The fallback inspects components with `O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW`, follows relative
symlink targets using a stack of retained directory descriptors, and rejects
absolute targets or `..` past the retained root with `EXDEV`. It permits at most
40 link expansions (`ELOOP` beyond that limit). Final `O_NOFOLLOW` and exclusive
creation retain their syscall semantics, including opening the link itself with
`O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW` and creating through a dangling in-root relative link.
Exact device/inode/type identities are checked before and after the final
no-follow open; followed links also retain their descriptors and have their
named identities and target strings rechecked. Detected replacements fail with
`EXDEV`, including changes to directories left behind by a link's `..` target.

The fallback also honors `nosymfollow` mount restrictions on retained links.
Two conservative restrictions remain: the fallback refuses to follow **any
procfs symlink** with `ELOOP`, including ordinary links such as `/proc/mounts`.
Userspace metadata cannot distinguish these from procfs magic links, which
`RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS` must never follow. Opening a final link itself with
`O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW` remains allowed. In a sticky, world-writable directory,
the fallback refuses all symlink following with `EACCES`, even when the calling
thread or directory owner owns the link, or `fs.protected_symlinks=0`. This
preserves Linux's protected-symlink restriction without assuming the thread's
filesystem UID or treating equal mapped `stat` UIDs as proof of equal kernel
owners (distinct unmapped owners can both appear as the overflow UID).

Public Root policy and canonical-path admission, hardlink rejection, pinned-file checks, and mutation
identity fences remain in place. `openBeneath()` reports `best-effort`: these
identity samples detect replacements but cannot make a multi-component walk
atomic against a hostile process renaming directories between samples. This
is the same documented containment class as the macOS and JavaScript paths;
applications requiring atomic beneath resolution must check the result or use
OS isolation. Rejection after a mutating open does not promise rollback.

Nested no-clobber `Root.move()` still admits both parents and uses
`renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`. Existing destinations are never overwritten.
That separate syscall/filesystem capability remains required; if unavailable,
the operation fails with `helper-unavailable`. Turning native mode `off` still
disables no-clobber moves because Node has no equivalent atomic rename API.

Bounded owned-tree cleanup deliberately has no `openat` fallback:
`RESOLVE_NO_XDEV` rejects bind mounts even when device numbers match, which
ordinary identity checks cannot reproduce. `cleanupSafety: "require-bounded"`
fails before workspace creation with `helper-unavailable`; low-level cleanup
opens report `ENOTSUP`. Compatible cleanup retains its documented behavior.
Low-level `O_TMPFILE` anonymous opens also fail before creation with `ENOTSUP`
in the fallback, because named-entry identity checks cannot verify an unnamed
file. Public staged-write APIs use exclusive named files and remain available.

For tests, set `FS_SAFE_TEST_NO_OPENAT2=1` before starting Node to force the
fallback (including bounded-cleanup refusal). It is read only at the first
capability probe. It has no effect on macOS or Windows.
See [Linux fallback testing](testing.md#linux-openat2-fallback).

## Archives

Native ZIP and TAR entry reads retain a private, unpooled input Buffer in
the async reader. ZIP reuses its parsed directory; TAR retains admitted member
offsets. TypeScript validates and selects the requested member before reading. The internal binding borrows that allocation: it must never be
mutated or detached while the reader or a read task exists. The public API only
accepts a pathname and owns this buffer exclusively. An N-API reference keeps
the bytes alive; a mutex serializes access to the retained ZIP cursor. Plain
TAR copies only the selected range after complete admission, while gzip, zstd,
and bzip2 replay bounded decompression and validate the full physical stream.
Concurrent TAR reads share immutable input and own separate decoder state.
Each output owns a new vector, which N-API transfers to Node without a second
payload copy on runtimes supporting external buffers. No entry-read path
requires temporary-file staging. Extraction retains its private staged input.

Rust streams ZIP and TAR payloads, including gzip, zstd, and bzip2. It first
returns a bounded manifest. TypeScript applies the shared path, filter, strip,
mode, and byte policies and returns an index-bound extraction plan. Rust then
creates only those planned entries beneath a private staging descriptor.

The `fs-safe-archive-core` Rust workspace crate owns TAR framing, paths, types,
mode decoding, GNU metadata, and byte-counted local PAX records. The native
binding and bundled WASM module compile the same source. No `tar::Archive` or
Node TAR parser reinterprets admitted identities or sizes. Executors replay
admitted payload ranges after complete bounded admission; native writes retain
the platform's descriptor-relative primitives, while fallback writes retain
the guarded Node staging/publication boundary. ZIP behavior is unchanged.
`maxMetaEntryBytes` bounds bodies before allocation; unsupported global/old
metadata and sparse forms fail closed. See [bounded local PAX support](archive.md#bounded-local-pax-support).

The bundled module also compiles the same zstd and bzip2 codec implementations
used by native. In `off` or missing-native `auto`, those decoders feed the shared
TAR parser through fixed 64 KiB windows in one import-free WASM session with a
256 MiB linear-memory ceiling. Gzip retains Node's built-in decoder. Complete
container and TAR admission precedes policy evaluation and guarded publication;
concatenated compressed members and zstd skippable frames are consumed through
physical EOF. No runtime command, interpreter, download, or consumer compilation
is needed for these archive routes. `require` stays strict, and available native
operation failures do not retry through WASM. Public `inspectTarArchive()` still
accepts only plain TAR/gzip; ZIP fallback still requires optional JSZip.

Every raw pass receives only TypeScript's resolved `maxEntries`,
`maxMetaEntryBytes`, and `maxDecodedBytes`. Shared resolution caps metadata and
decoded byte fields at JavaScript's safe-integer maximum and entry counts at
`2^32 - 1` before backend selection. Large finite limits remain accepted;
native conversion mirrors those caps and rejects malformed non-finite or
negative direct-call values before casting. Logical member headers count
before filtering/stripping; metadata records do not. `maxEntryBytes` and
`maxExtractedBytes` remain exclusively in TypeScript's accepted-plan builder,
after strip/filter policy, and are absent from the raw meter's interface.
Bounded reads use the default count/metadata/decoded bounds; public `maxBytes`
bounds only the requested output. TypeScript derives the internal decoded cap
by safely adding `maxExtractedBytes` and `maxArchiveBytes`, clamped to the safe
integer maximum. Every native pass receives that same cap and charges headers,
metadata, bodies, padding, EOF blocks, and trailing zeros. It rejects overflow
with `archive-decoded-size-exceeds-limit`; no ratio policy is implied.
Extraction and entry reads drain the metered reader through physical EOF after
admitted-range replay. Trailing framing or decoded-limit failures propagate before
directory modes are finalized, staging is published, or selected bytes return.
Native gzip uses the existing flate2 member decoder with an explicit bounded
member/padding transition; JavaScript retains Node gunzip and validates its
unconsumed compressed suffix. Only all-zero physical padding after a complete
validated trailer is accepted, still within the original archive-byte budget.
Native reads stop at framing boundaries so a rejected header does not request
its body from the decoder; codec buffering can still read ahead internally.
Inspection finishes the complete bounded framing pass before returning its manifest. Directory
and link bodies, missing two-block EOF, and nonzero trailers reject on both
backends, as detailed in [raw TAR framing](archive.md#raw-tar-framing). Raw and
padded sizes above JavaScript's safe-integer maximum reject as invalid framing
before applying member budgets, including when local PAX overrides the size.

## Publication and hashing

Exclusive publication tries a hardlink, then a copy-on-write clone, Linux
`copy_file_range`, and finally the existing asynchronous JavaScript byte loop.
All routes preserve `wx` semantics and the same source/target identity and
SHA-256 fencing. Native hashing and Linux whole-file copying run on N-API async
workers rather than the JavaScript event loop.

Linux range copying confirms every zero-byte result with a positioned source
read at the current transfer offset, including after earlier calls copied data.
If readable bytes remain, automatic Root copying resumes its byte loop from
that offset; exclusive publication removes its partial target before retrying
the guarded byte-copy fallback. EOF checks preserve descriptor cursors and do
not bypass the byte limit.

## Mode semantics

| Mode | Native loading | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` | Try once, cache the result | Use guarded JavaScript when safe; reject native-only operations |
| `require` | Try once, cache the result | Throw `FsSafeError("helper-unavailable")` |
| `off` | Never attempt a binding load | Use guarded JavaScript when safe; reject native-only operations |

`sha256FileSync()` is a synchronous Node implementation in all three modes and
does not load the binding. Use asynchronous `sha256File()` for native hashing
and cancellation that can respond while JavaScript callbacks run.

Features without a safe fallback, including no-clobber
`Root.move()` and
[retained-directory staging](staged-file.md), fail with `helper-unavailable`
when native support is absent or off. Staging is currently Linux/macOS only and
rejects Windows with `unsupported-platform`.

Windows raw owner/DACL inspection, private-directory creation, and secure-file
descriptor inspection can use a package-shipped, readable `.ps1` driver and
adjacent `.cs` source in `auto` or `off` mode when their binding or capability is
unavailable. System Windows PowerShell runs the fixed driver with `-File`;
paths remain data, with no runtime-generated helper script or encoded launcher.
The [Windows security fallback prerequisites](install.md#windows-security-fallback)
apply, and unsupported or disallowed command execution fails closed. This route
preserves raw ACL facts, private DACLs at creation, and descriptor-bound secure
reads, and emits a path-free `FS_SAFE_NATIVE_FALLBACK` warning once per capability
per process. Each call adds PowerShell startup and compilation overhead.
`require` rejects missing capabilities without a command, and an available native operation's
failure never triggers this fallback. See [Permissions](permissions.md) and
[Secure file reads](secure-file.md) for error and platform contracts.

The staged-file owner also serves POSIX native pinned writes, including streaming.
Unpublished files remain at `0600`; requested modes are applied through the
owned file descriptor only after rename and published-entry identity validation.
Post-rename chmod or sync failures retain the publication receipt and final name.
Its direct-child exclusive `openat` hands off the descriptor before any fallible
post-open checks; non-following `statat` compares against that descriptor with
exact native identities, and cleanup uses `unlinkat` in the retained parent.
The separate checks and unlink are not atomic conditional deletion. Windows
pinned writes and other fallback-capable APIs retain their existing mechanisms.
Native writers share root and parent admission, but keep their platform identity
checks and leaf ownership. POSIX coordinator disposal uses `SuppressedError` to
retain both an operation failure and a disposal failure, including their receipts;
stage preparation and cleanup keep their documented error mappings.
Root replacement verification borrows the published descriptor after final mode
application, while a private coordinator retains the staged owner until the
asynchronous check finishes. The owner never escapes that coordinator; public
staging methods and receipts expose no descriptor or verification callback.
Verification failures preserve the published name, and disposal still retains
both verification and cleanup errors when both fail.
The private verification channel carries exact bigint identity from the original
owned descriptor (or the content-accepted FUSE descriptor). Root compares it
against exact fd and pathname metadata; legacy helper return facts and public
read metadata behavior are unchanged. Missing Windows pathname identity still
requires a guarded path reopen and comparison with the original retained file;
that fallback does not apply to POSIX no-read modes.

## JavaScript fallback guarantees and delta

Policy-bound parent creation can refresh exact directory facts through the
retained POSIX descriptor. The optional native observer compares descriptor and
no-follow pathname metadata and verifies the descriptor's canonical path before
and after the observation. Ordinary paths can share that observation within one
synchronous admission phase; callbacks, mutations, and later phases require fresh
evidence. Unsupported helpers retain the guarded pathname checks. Policy and
denied-path decisions remain in TypeScript.

Public policy does not change with the selected mechanism: traversal and link
rejection, archive filters/limits/modes, exclusive target creation, source and
target identity fencing, publication cleanup receipts, and secret/lock policy
remain TypeScript-owned. What changes is the syscall strength or availability:

The table compares underlying mechanisms. On Node, public `Root.open()`,
`Root.read()`, and `Root.openWritable()` use guarded Node file opens and report
`containment: "best-effort"` in every native mode. `require` checks availability
when an operation requests native support; it does not upgrade those results.
See [Root containment guarantees](security-model.md#containment-guarantees-by-platform).

| Capability | Native path | Guarded JavaScript path |
|---|---|---|
| Native beneath opens and Root mutations | Descriptor-relative beneath operations. Pinned writes create parents and publish both replacement and no-replace targets relative to open directory descriptors. No-clobber `Root.move()` admits both parents and uses the native no-replace rename. Native `openBeneath()` reports `kernel-atomic` with Linux `openat2` and `best-effort` with the guarded Linux fallback, macOS, and Windows. macOS uses `O_RESOLVE_BENEATH` when available plus an `F_GETPATH` detector, while Windows rejects reparse traversal in the object-manager call. | Reports `best-effort`: component-wise alias checks, no-follow opens where Node exposes them, private temp/rename, and post-operation identity verification. No-clobber `Root.move()` is unsupported because a check followed by a replacing rename is unsafe. A same-privilege peer can replace a writable parent after a guard assertion but before Node resolves another pathname mutation; the mutation may land outside the intended root before the post-check detects it. |
| ZIP/TAR/gzip | Rust streaming decode and fd-relative output creation. | Optional JSZip or bundled WASM TAR into guarded private staging, then the same guarded merge policy. |
| Zstd/bzip2 TAR | Rust streaming decode and fd-relative output creation. | Bundled WASM codecs feed the shared Rust TAR parser, then guarded private staging and the same merge policy; no optional codec dependency. |
| Publication copy | Clone, Linux `copy_file_range`, async native SHA-256. | Exclusive `wx` byte loop and Node SHA-256 with the same content/identity fences. |
| `rename-noreplace` | Atomic platform no-replace rename. | Unsupported; no emulation by check-then-rename. |
| Windows DACL read | Direct `GetSecurityInfo`; the public facts API exposes ordered basic allow/deny ACE SIDs, masks, and decoded flags without trust policy. Secure-file reads query the borrowed open descriptor and compare its 32-bit volume serial and 64-bit file-index projection with Node's bigint receipt. | The packaged PowerShell/C# bridge preserves raw facts and inspects the borrowed descriptor for secure reads, with the same Node identity comparison; its command failures reject. Structured .NET pathname reporting retains its separate compatibility query. |
| Windows private directory | Creation-time protected DACL. | The packaged PowerShell/C# bridge applies the protected DACL at creation and retains exact handles through identity validation and failure cleanup. Command failures reject. |

Use `off` in CI to keep the fallback contract exercised. Use `require` when a
deployment depends on the stronger mechanism or a native-only feature; do not
infer native loading from timing.

## Loader security

Importing fs-safe never executes a child process. Linux libc selection uses
the Node process report, then the ELF `PT_INTERP` field of `process.execPath`,
then conventional musl library filenames. An installed compatibility loader
does not override the running executable's interpreter. If all probes are inconclusive, the
loader conservatively attempts the glibc package and lets normal module loading
fail into `auto` fallback. The loader requires only the package selected from
the detected target; it never probes unrelated packages, downloads code, or
runs a postinstall step. A missing or incompatible binary
silently selects the JavaScript fallback in `auto`, throws typed
`helper-unavailable` in `require`, and is never inspected in `off`. Tests reject
`child_process`, `exec`, or `spawn` usage in the loader.
