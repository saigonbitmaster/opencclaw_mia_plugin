# Reading

The `Root` handle exposes five read shapes. Pick the narrowest one that gives you what you need — narrower shapes do less work and surface fewer footguns.

```ts
const result = await fs.read("notes/today.txt");        // { buffer, containment, realPath, stat }
const text   = await fs.readText("notes/today.txt");    // string
const bytes  = await fs.readBytes("image.png");         // Buffer
const json   = await fs.readJson<Config>("config.json"); // T
const opened = await fs.open("large.log");               // FileHandle for streaming
```

## What every read does

Identity and containment checks use brief synchronous metadata calls, like Node's module resolution, while file data is read asynchronously. Canonical paths retain Node's native realpath spelling, including expansion of Windows short paths.

The same observation rule applies to archive extraction, copy, publication, move,
directory modes, and supporting lock, queue, and secret-file operations. Opens,
data transfers, durability syncs, filesystem mutations, and closes retain their
existing asynchronous behavior. Custom filesystem adapters retain their async
metadata interface.

Regardless of shape, every read goes through the same boundary checks:

1. Resolve the input lexically against the canonical real root.
2. Reject a lexically explicit unsafe device or process-fd namespace (`device-path`). This check precedes component alias policy because paths such as `/dev/fd` are themselves symlinks on common Linux hosts.
3. Resolve path components and reject anything that escapes the root (`outside-workspace`).
4. Reject `..` traversal and absolute spellings when they resolve outside the root. In-root absolute spellings remain accepted; `readAbsolute` makes that intent explicit.
5. Open with `O_NOFOLLOW` where available. Any remaining symlink in the path triggers `symlink` unless the call's `symlinks` policy is `follow-within-root`.
6. Compare the pre-open bigint path identity with the open fd, then perform one best-effort final admission: check the captured root identity, compare the policy-aware pathname with the fd, freshly canonicalize and re-admit that target inside the captured root, compare its exact bigint identity without following a final symlink with the fd, and check the root again. Both final pathname observations run even when their spellings match. An observed swap triggers `path-mismatch` or `outside-workspace`; a missing final path triggers `not-found`.
7. If `hardlinks: "reject"`, refuse files with `nlink > 1` (`hardlink`), including links introduced before either fresh final pathname observation. Root-file helpers apply the same final check when `rejectHardlinks` is enabled; directory admission is unaffected.
8. If `maxBytes` is set, refuse reads larger than the cap (`too-large`).

The final fence closes a rejected descriptor before any Root read consumes bytes or
`open()` hands the descriptor to its caller. It is a sequence of filesystem
observations, not an atomic kernel pathname/open primitive, so a hostile peer can
still race the namespace after the last observation. Standalone absolute-file
helpers have no captured `Root` identity and do not claim this replacement-root
fence; use a `Root` for untrusted paths.

## Read shapes

### `fs.read(rel, options?)`

The full result. Use it when you need both the bytes and the verified `realPath` or `stat`:

```ts
const { buffer, containment, realPath, stat } = await fs.read("notes/today.txt");
console.log(`${stat.size} bytes at ${realPath}`);
```

### `fs.readText(rel, options?)`

`buffer.toString(encoding)`. Defaults to `"utf8"`; encoding is a per-call text
option, not a `RootDefaults` field:

```ts
const utf16 = await fs.readText("doc.txt", { encoding: "utf16le" });
```

### `fs.readBytes(rel, options?)`

The buffer alone. Useful when you don't care about the realPath or stat:

```ts
const png = await fs.readBytes("image.png");
```

### `fs.readJson<T>(rel, options?)`

`readText` + `JSON.parse`. The generic is a *cast*, not a validator — validate the parsed value at your application boundary if it came from a less-trusted source.

```ts
type Config = { tokens: string[] };
const config = await fs.readJson<Config>("config.json");
```

For tighter control over malformed-or-missing JSON, use the standalone helpers in [`@openclaw/fs-safe/json`](json.md): `tryReadJson` (returns `null` on missing/invalid) vs `readJson` (throws).

### `fs.open(rel, options?)`

Returns a `FileHandle` plus `containment: "best-effort"`, the verified `realPath`, and `stat`. Use this for streaming or partial reads, and **always close the handle**:

```ts
const opened = await fs.open("large.log");
try {
  const stream = opened.handle.createReadStream();
  for await (const chunk of stream) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk);
  }
} finally {
  await opened.handle.close();
}
```

## Read options

```ts
type RootReadOptions = {
  hardlinks?: "reject" | "allow";   // override defaults.hardlinks
  maxBytes?: number;                // refuse reads larger than this many bytes
  nonBlockingRead?: boolean;        // compatibility hint; safe opens are already nonblocking where supported
  symlinks?: "reject" | "follow-within-root" | "follow-parents-within-root"; // override defaults.symlinks
};
```

`maxBytes` is enforced eagerly: the library reads up to `maxBytes + 1` and throws `too-large` if there is more, so a hostile target cannot silently exhaust memory. Values must be non-negative safe integers or positive `Infinity`; zero is an active cap, while `Infinity` disables it. Explicitly forwarding `undefined` preserves the Root default.

`nonBlockingRead` remains as a compatibility hint. Safe reads always add the platform's nonblocking open flag where available so a raced FIFO cannot pin a worker indefinitely; regular-file descriptor reads retain normal Node behavior.

## `readAbsolute()` and `reader()`

Some APIs hand you an absolute path that the caller has already produced. Going back to a relative form just to call `read()` is awkward, so the library exposes:

```ts
fs.readAbsolute(absPath, options?)   // ReadResult, abs path must be inside the root
fs.reader(options?)              // (path) => Promise<Buffer>
```

`readAbsolute` accepts absolute paths using either the configured root spelling
or its canonical real path. This includes roots configured through a directory
symlink or Windows junction. Anything outside the root throws
`outside-workspace`. It also accepts relative paths for compatibility, but use
`read()`/`readBytes()` when the input contract is explicitly relative.

`reader()` returns a closure that takes either a relative or an absolute path and returns a Buffer. Useful for plugging `fs-safe` into framework loader hooks:

```ts
const load = fs.reader({ maxBytes: 4 * 1024 * 1024 });
await someLibrary.parseTemplate({ load });
```

## Inspection vs reading

`fs.exists`, `fs.stat`, and `fs.list` are advisory. They are safe to call to drive UI or decisions, but they do **not** pin the file:

```ts
if (await fs.exists("notes/today.txt")) {
  // the file existed when stat() ran — it may not now
  const text = await fs.readText("notes/today.txt"); // this is the call that pins
}
```

A symlink swap between `exists` and `readText` is checked again by the read; the boundary and its documented race window are per-call.

## Streaming patterns

### Read into a writable stream

```ts
import { pipeline } from "node:stream/promises";

const opened = await fs.open("large.log");
try {
  await pipeline(opened.handle.createReadStream(), process.stdout);
} finally {
  await opened.handle.close();
}
```

### Read in chunks

```ts
const opened = await fs.open("large.bin");
try {
  const buf = Buffer.alloc(64 * 1024);
  let off = 0;
  while (true) {
    const { bytesRead } = await opened.handle.read(buf, 0, buf.length, off);
    if (bytesRead === 0) break;
    consume(buf.subarray(0, bytesRead));
    off += bytesRead;
  }
} finally {
  await opened.handle.close();
}
```

## Common errors

- **`outside-workspace`** — relative path escaped the root, or `readAbsolute` got an absolute path outside.
- **`not-found`** — the file is gone.
- **`not-file`** — you read a directory or a non-regular file (FIFO, socket, …).
- **`device-path`** — the path targets a known unsafe device or process fd path.
- **`symlink`** — a path component is a symlink and the policy is `reject`.
- **`path-mismatch`** — opened fd identity did not match the resolved path. Almost always a TOCTOU swap by something else.
- **`hardlink`** — `hardlinks: "reject"` saw `nlink > 1`.
- **`too-large`** — read exceeded `maxBytes`.
