# Directory durability

`@openclaw/fs-safe/durability` provides the directory side of crash-safe file
publication. Flushing a file does not guarantee that its containing directory
entry reached storage; callers that promise durable create, link, rename, or
unlink operations must also synchronize the affected directory.

```ts
import {
  ensureDurableDirectory,
  pinDirectory,
} from "@openclaw/fs-safe/durability";

const repository = await ensureDurableDirectory({
  directoryPath: "/srv/backups/sqlite",
  mode: 0o700,
});

const pinned = await pinDirectory(repository, { label: "backup repository" });
try {
  await publishSnapshot();
  const outcome = await pinned.sync();
  if (outcome.status === "unsupported") {
    // Decide at the product boundary whether this platform can weaken the promise.
  }
} finally {
  await pinned.close();
}
```

## Outcomes and failure semantics

`syncDirectory()` and `PinnedDirectory.sync()` return:

```ts
type DirectorySyncOutcome =
  | { status: "synced" }
  | { status: "unsupported"; code?: string };
```

POSIX synchronization failures propagate. Windows directory handles do not
portably support `FlushFileBuffers`; the known unsupported error family is
reported as `unsupported` after the pathname and pinned identity are checked
again. Directory-open access failures and other Windows I/O failures still
propagate.

`syncDirectoryBestEffort()` and `syncDirectoryBestEffortSync()` intentionally
discard both unsupported outcomes and failures. Use them only when the primary
write remains useful without a crash-durability promise.

On Windows, pathname inputs and supplied directory receipts reject NTFS
alternate-stream and directory-index namespace spellings before opening,
creating, hashing, or publishing anything. This applies to directory
durability, `publishFileExclusive()`, and the pathname overloads of
`sha256File()` and `sha256FileSync()`; the already-open `FileHandle` and
borrowed numeric file-descriptor overloads are unchanged. Ordinary colon-bearing
POSIX paths remain valid.

## Pinned directories

`pinDirectory()` rejects final symlinks and non-directories. On POSIX it opens
with `O_DIRECTORY`, `O_NOFOLLOW`, and `O_NONBLOCK`, then compares the open
descriptor, pathname identity, and canonical path. `assertCurrent()` repeats
those checks. This prevents a pathname replacement from turning a later sync
into proof for a different directory.

Pathname and descriptor checks compare exact bigint device and inode values.
Each inspection allows one retry for unknown Windows identity components,
retaining known components and rejecting definite mismatches immediately.
Persistent unknown identity fails closed with `path-mismatch`, including on an
otherwise usable directory. A failed preflight identity check never syncs the
descriptor; a replacement discovered after sync still rejects the operation.

`DirectoryReceipt.identity` remains a numeric Node `Stats` object for metadata
compatibility, projected from the same exact observation as the private
identity. Library-created receipts and their identity objects retain a
private exact snapshot; mutating their public fields cannot change the
directory authorized by that snapshot. Each returned receipt owns a mutable
numeric metadata copy. Later admissions retain the original metadata snapshot
even if advisory fields such as mode or timestamps were edited; changed paths
or identity components reject. Pass the receipt or its original
identity object through to later operations to retain this evidence. A copied
or reconstructed numeric identity is accepted only when both components are
safe integers and, on Windows, nonzero. Rounded or unknown caller identities
fail with `path-mismatch` rather than authorizing a different directory.

Caller-supplied receipts may use `DirectoryReceipt<BigIntStats>` with the result
of `lstat(path, { bigint: true })`. `pinDirectory()`, `syncDirectory()`,
`syncDirectorySync()`, `publishFileExclusive()`'s `parentReceipt`, and
`stageFileInDirectory()` accept both numeric and bigint receipt inputs.
`DirectoryReceipt` without a type argument and all returned durability receipts
still expose numeric `Stats`, including working type predicates and Date
properties. Bigint metadata is projected from the supplied observation, retaining
fractional timestamps and the private exact device/inode identity.

```ts
import { lstatSync, realpathSync, type BigIntStats } from "node:fs";
import { syncDirectorySync, type DirectoryReceipt } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/durability";

const directoryPath = "/srv/backups/sqlite";
const receipt: DirectoryReceipt<BigIntStats> = {
  path: directoryPath,
  realPath: realpathSync(directoryPath),
  identity: lstatSync(directoryPath, { bigint: true }),
};
// Keep this receipt across the application's publication operation.
const outcome = syncDirectorySync(receipt);
```

Call `close()` in `finally`. Closing is idempotent; using a closed pin fails.

These checks intentionally reject a moved or replaced pathname. For one file's
abort cleanup through its original directory after a move, use the separate
[retained-directory staging lifecycle](staged-file.md). Its cleanup authority
does not weaken `pinDirectory().assertCurrent()` or `.sync()`, and namespace
cleanup is not proof of crash durability.

## Durable directory creation

`ensureDurableDirectory()` finds and pins the nearest existing ancestor,
creates the requested path, opens every new directory segment, and synchronizes
each new parent-to-child edge from the leaf upward. It returns the final
directory receipt plus the aggregate parent-sync outcome.

By default it uses fs-safe's guarded one-segment-at-a-time absolute-directory
creator. Advanced callers can pass `create` when directory creation needs
platform-specific ACLs or another product-owned policy. The callback owns the
safety of its mutations and must create exactly `directoryPath`; fs-safe
validates and pins every resulting segment before any synchronization is
accepted.

`expectedExistingIdentity` binds an existing target to an identity observed by
the caller before a separate permission or policy check. A missing or replaced
target fails with `FsSafeError("path-mismatch")`.
Use bigint `dev` and `ino` from `lstat(path, { bigint: true })` or
[`readDirectoryIdentity()`](directory-identity.md) for caller-owned observations
that may exceed the numeric safe-integer range. An original library receipt's
`identity` object also retains its private exact identity for this option.

## Exclusive file publication

`publishFileExclusive()` materializes one file without clobbering an existing
target. It pins the source with nonblocking `O_NOFOLLOW`, optionally verifies
`expectedSourceIdentity`, tries a hardlink first, then synchronizes the target
parent directory.

Trusted relative source and target paths are resolved to absolute paths before
authority checks. On Windows, ordinary drive-relative operands are anchored at
entry before namespace-alias admission. A caller-supplied `parentReceipt` must
still name the resolved target parent and is not relaxed by this compatibility
rule.

For example, a backup archive is complete before publication. If directory
sync fails, keeping that complete file is more useful than conditionally
deleting it by pathname:

```ts
import { FsSafeError } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/errors";
import { publishFileExclusive } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/durability";

try {
  const result = await publishFileExclusive({
    sourcePath: stagedArchive,
    targetPath: finalArchive,
    strategy: "link-or-copy",
    onSyncFailure: "preserve",
    parentReceipt: backupDirectory,
  });
  recordDurableBackup(result.identity, result.directorySync);
} catch (error) {
  if (
    error instanceof FsSafeError &&
    error.details?.phase === "directory-sync" &&
    error.details.cleanup === "preserved"
  ) {
    recordCompleteButPossiblyNonDurableBackup(finalArchive, error.details);
  } else {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Strategies

| Strategy | Behavior | Native requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `link-required` | Create a same-filesystem hardlink or propagate the failure. | No; guarded JS `link` fallback remains. |
| `link-or-copy` | Try hardlink, then clone, Linux `copy_file_range`, then the JS byte loop for classified unsupported errors. | No; acceleration is optional. |
| `rename-noreplace` | Atomically move the source without replacing an existing target. Success consumes `sourcePath`. | Yes. |

`"link-required"` propagates an unsupported hardlink failure.
`"link-or-copy"` falls back only for `EPERM`, `EXDEV`, `ENOTSUP`,
`EOPNOTSUPP`, or `ENOSYS`; `isHardlinkFallbackError()` exposes that exact
classifier. The fallback copies from the pinned source into a `wx` target,
fsyncs it, and fences source and target identity and content before reporting
success. `parentReceipt`, when supplied, must name the target's direct parent.

With a native binding, the copy fallback first attempts a copy-on-write clone
(`fclonefileat` on macOS, `FICLONE` on Linux), then Linux
`copy_file_range`, and finally the existing JavaScript byte loop. Every route
creates the target exclusively, applies mode `0o600` through its owned
descriptor independently of the process umask, and goes through the same
post-copy identity and SHA-256 fencing. Hashing uses an async
native task when available, so large verification reads do not occupy the
JavaScript event loop.

On a clone-capable filesystem, publication of a large file becomes mostly a
metadata operation: data blocks are shared copy-on-write until either file is
modified. Clone support is filesystem- and mount-dependent, so callers must
not infer durability or physical independence from timing; an unsupported
clone or `copy_file_range` transparently continues down the fallback chain.

## Recoverable atomic-replace fallback

`replaceFileAtomic()` normally publishes a synchronized sibling temp with an
atomic rename. Some Windows filesystems and file owners reject that rename with
`EPERM` or `EEXIST`; `copyFallbackOnPermissionError: true` permits a non-atomic
copy fallback.

Callers that cannot tolerate a torn in-place fallback can add:

```ts
await replaceFileAtomic({
  filePath: statePath,
  content: nextState,
  syncTempFile: true,
  syncParentDir: true,
  copyFallbackOnPermissionError: true,
  copyFallbackRestore: "restore-original",
  maxRestoreBytes: 4 * 1024 * 1024,
  destinationHardlinks: "reject",
});
```

The existing regular-file destination is pinned before its link count is
accepted. Its original bytes are read within `maxRestoreBytes`, then the new
bytes are written and synchronized through the same descriptor. If a write or
sync tears, fs-safe rewrites the snapshot and fsyncs it before throwing. Inspect
`details.cleanup`: `"restored"` means the original bytes were put back and
synchronized; `"restore-failed"` means the replacement and recovery both
failed, so the destination must be treated as indeterminate. This is recovery
from a live-process I/O failure, not a transaction or a substitute for an
application backup protocol.

## Streaming SHA-256

`sha256File()` hashes either a pathname string or an already-open Node
`FileHandle`. A backup verifier can pin the file itself, compare its size, and
keep ownership of the handle:

```ts
import { open } from "node:fs/promises";
import { sha256File } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/durability";

const snapshot = await open(stagedArchive, "r");
try {
  const before = await snapshot.stat();
  const hash = await sha256File(snapshot, { maxBytes: before.size });
  if (hash.bytes !== before.size || hash.digest !== manifest.sha256) {
    throw new Error("staged backup does not match its manifest");
  }
} finally {
  await snapshot.close();
}
```

The result is `{ bytes, digest }`, where `digest` is lowercase hexadecimal.
The optional `Sha256FileOptions` argument supports `maxBytes` and `signal`.
`maxBytes` accepts a non-negative safe integer (including zero), or
`Infinity` for no limit, which is also the default. Oversized files reject with
`FsSafeError("too-large")`; reads stay bounded to at most `maxBytes + 1` bytes,
even if the file grows after its initial size check. Hashing never silently
truncates to the limit.

Pass `signal` to cancel. A pre-aborted signal rejects before file I/O or native
loading. In-flight cancellation is cooperative between reads and rejects with
the signal's original reason only after the pending read or native task stops.
Callers may close their handle after awaiting rejection; do not close it while
the operation is pending. A signal can be shared by successive or concurrent
hashes. Neither mode provides a snapshot of concurrently modified contents;
callers requiring stable content must also fence identity and metadata.

The handle overload never closes the caller's descriptor and uses positioned
reads, so it does not alter the descriptor's current offset. The path overload
rejects symbolic links and non-regular files, compares lossless bigint identities
from the pre-open pathname inspection to the opened descriptor and from that
descriptor to the current pathname, and closes its own handle. All identity
checks complete before any JavaScript or native hashing. Each inspection allows
one bounded retry for unknown Windows identity components, retaining known
components and rejecting known differences immediately. Persistent unknown
identity fails closed with `path-mismatch`, even for benign files: this trades
availability for verifiable identity. Retries inspect the same descriptor or
pathname without reopening the file and repeat the symlink and file-type checks.
POSIX opens are nonblocking, so a raced FIFO or device is rejected after
descriptor inspection rather than waiting for a writer.

A pathname hash reports failure to close its owned descriptor after successful
hashing. If hashing, admission, or cancellation already failed, that original
failure remains primary even when close also fails. This also applies to
`sha256FileSync()`; borrowed handles and descriptors remain caller-owned.

When the optional binding is active, hashing runs as an async native task and
does not occupy the JavaScript event loop with digest updates. With native mode
`off`, or in `auto` when no binding loads, the fallback performs asynchronous
positioned reads in chunks of up to 256 KiB but updates Node's `Hash` on the JavaScript
thread. Both paths stream bounded buffers rather than loading the file into memory.
The fallback sizes its scratch buffer to small files and grows it if a stale
size hint is exceeded, while still probing for actual EOF and byte-limit overflow.
Native mode `require` keeps its usual fail-closed loader semantics.

### Synchronous hashing

`sha256FileSync()` accepts a pathname or a borrowed numeric file descriptor and
returns the same `{ bytes, digest }` result. It shares `Sha256FileOptions`,
including the default unlimited byte budget and `too-large` errors for growth
beyond `maxBytes`. It always reads from offset zero with bounded positional
`readSync` calls and leaves a borrowed descriptor open at its original position.
Path inputs use the same regular-file, final-symlink, nonblocking-open, and exact
bigint admission checks described above, then close their owned descriptor.
These checks do not provide ancestor confinement or a snapshot of concurrent edits.

```ts
import { closeSync, openSync } from "node:fs";
import { sha256FileSync } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/durability";

const fd = openSync(stagedArchive, "r");
try {
  const hash = sha256FileSync(fd, { maxBytes: manifest.sizeBytes });
  if (hash.bytes !== manifest.sizeBytes || hash.digest !== manifest.sha256) {
    throw new Error("staged backup does not match its manifest");
  }
} finally {
  closeSync(fd);
}
```

The synchronous API uses Node's crypto implementation in every native mode,
including `require`; it never loads a native binding. It blocks the calling
thread until hashing finishes or throws. A pre-aborted signal fails before I/O,
and synchronous signal changes are checked between operations with the original
reason preserved. Timers and other JavaScript callbacks cannot run while the
hash is executing; use `sha256File()` when responsive cancellation is needed.

## Publication failure receipts

If `publishFileExclusive()` fails after creating the target, it throws an
`FsSafeError` with a `details` receipt:

```ts
type PublishFileExclusiveFailureDetails = {
  phase:
    | "hardlink-create" | "hardlink-verify"
    | "copy-create" | "copy-verify"
    | "rename-create" | "rename-verify"
    | "directory-sync";
  targetCreated: boolean;
  targetIdentity?: { dev: number | bigint; ino: number | bigint };
  cleanup: "removed" | "preserved" | "unknown";
  directorySync?: { status: "failed"; code?: string };
};
```

`"removed"` means the path still matched the identity created by this call and
was unlinked (or was already absent). `"preserved"` means it was deliberately
retained—for example after a successful no-replace rename—or the pathname had
been replaced and therefore was not safe to remove. `"unknown"` means cleanup
could not verify or remove the created identity. Callers that run a second
application-level guard, such as SQLite snapshot validation, should branch on
this receipt instead of inferring ownership from path existence. The original
failure remains available as `cause`. Failures before target creation retain
their existing error shape and do not claim a cleanup result.

Source and target identities are checked again after successful or unsupported
directory synchronization, while their descriptors remain owned. A late
verification failure retains its strategy's verification phase and is not a
directory-sync failure. Completed copied targets stay pinned during conditional
cleanup; substituted entries remain untouched. Returned numeric metadata comes
from the retained target descriptor and grants no continuing pathname authority.

### Directory-sync failure policy

`onSyncFailure` applies only after target creation and content/identity fencing
have succeeded but synchronizing the containing directory throws:

```ts
type PublishFileExclusiveSyncFailurePolicy = "rollback" | "preserve";
```

A returned `{ status: "unsupported", code? }` is an explicit successful
publication outcome, not a thrown sync failure, so this option does not rewrite
or clean up that target.

- `rollback` is the default. fs-safe removes the target only if its current
  identity still matches the file created by this call. A replacement is never
  removed. The error reports `cleanup: "removed"`, `"preserved"`, or
  `"unknown"` and `directorySync: { status: "failed", code? }`.
- `preserve` never attempts that unlink. The error reports
  `targetCreated: true`, `cleanup: "preserved"`, the created identity, and the
  failed directory-sync outcome. The file is complete and fenced, but its
  directory entry is not proven crash-durable.

Choose `rollback` when the pathname must mean “durably committed” and a failed
commit should disappear from the live process view. Choose `preserve` when the
payload itself remains valuable—backup archives are the common case—and the
caller can record, retry, or independently validate durability. Neither choice
can make a failed directory sync succeed: rollback deletion is also not proven
durable, and a preserved name may disappear after a crash. Always use the
typed receipt rather than inferring ownership from `exists()`.

`rename-noreplace` always preserves its target after a successful rename,
because removing it would discard the source's only remaining name; its typed
failure receipt makes that explicit regardless of `onSyncFailure`.

`"rename-noreplace"` requires the native helper and atomically moves the
source to the target without replacement. A collision is reported as
`EEXIST`, both files remain unchanged, and a successful call returns
`method: "rename-noreplace"` after synchronizing the source and target parent
directories. Unlike the link/copy strategies, success consumes `sourcePath`.

## Scope

These primitives establish path identity and filesystem synchronization. One
`publishFileExclusive()` call is one no-clobber file materialization, not a
retention policy, multi-file transaction, or application commit protocol. They
do not decide application commit protocols, marker formats, permission policy,
or whether an unsupported platform is acceptable. Keep those decisions at the
owning product boundary.

## Existing Windows file retirement

[`retainFileInDirectory`](retained-file.md) describes identity-bound native
disposition and resource settlement separately from persistence. Its result is
always `persistence: "not-proven"`; neither accepted disposition nor observed
namespace absence is a directory/volume barrier or an application commit.
