# Secret files

Helpers for reading and writing credentials. Files are written at mode `0o600`, dirs at `0o700`, with a maximum read size to avoid OOM on bogus input.

```ts
import {
  createSecretFileAtomic,
  readSecretFile,
  readSecretFileSync,
  tryReadSecretFile,
  tryReadSecretFileSync,
  writeSecretFileAtomic,
  DEFAULT_SECRET_FILE_MAX_BYTES,
  PRIVATE_SECRET_DIR_MODE,
  PRIVATE_SECRET_FILE_MODE,
} from "@openclaw/fs-safe/secret";
```

## When to use these vs `writeJson`

| Use these when | Use `writeJson` when |
|---|---|
| The file is a credential (token, key, password). | The file is application state. |
| You want the parent directory created at `0o700` if missing. | You don't care about the parent directory mode. |
| You want a hard size cap on reads (to defend against bogus input). | You're reading bounded JSON state. |
| Mode `0o600` and the private parent policy are mandatory. | Standalone `writeJson` also defaults to `0o600`, but it does not enforce the secret-directory ownership and permission policy. |

## Constants

```ts
DEFAULT_SECRET_FILE_MAX_BYTES = 16 * 1024;  // 16 KiB
PRIVATE_SECRET_DIR_MODE = 0o700;
PRIVATE_SECRET_FILE_MODE = 0o600;
```

The 16 KiB cap is intentionally aggressive — credentials should be small. If you need bigger, pass `maxBytes` explicitly.

## Reading

### `tryReadSecretFileSync(filePath, label, options?)`

The missing-is-optional reader. It returns the trimmed secret string, or
`undefined` when the `filePath` argument is absent/blank or the target does not
exist. An existing empty file is invalid and throws, as do unreadable,
oversized, symlink, hardlink, and other validation failures.

```ts
import { tryReadSecretFileSync } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/secret";

const token = tryReadSecretFileSync("/var/lib/app/auth.token", "auth token");
if (token) {
  useToken(token);
} else {
  await reauthenticate();
}
```

### `readSecretFileSync(filePath, label, options?)`

Strict reader. Throws `FsSafeError` when the file is missing, too large, empty, unreadable, or rejected by the validation checks. Use when failing loudly is the right call:

```ts
const token = readSecretFileSync("/var/lib/app/auth.token", "auth token");
```

### Read options

```ts
type SecretFileReadOptions = {
  maxBytes?: number;         // default DEFAULT_SECRET_FILE_MAX_BYTES (16 KiB)
  rejectSymlink?: boolean;   // default false
  rejectHardlinks?: boolean; // default true
};
```

`maxBytes` must be a non-negative safe integer or positive `Infinity`; zero is an active cap, `Infinity` disables it, and omitted or explicitly `undefined` values preserve the 16 KiB default.

The reader trims the file content and rejects empty results. Symlink paths are
followed and pinned by default; set `rejectSymlink: true` when the pathname
itself must not be an alias. Hardlinks are rejected by default so another
in-tree name cannot alias the credential; pass `rejectHardlinks: false` only
when you explicitly trust that layout.

Read options are captured when the call starts. Mutating a shared options
object while an asynchronous read is in flight cannot relax its link policy.

These readers do not enforce ownership or mode bits on an existing file. Their
read contract covers pinned identity, file type, link policy, and byte bounds;
the `0o600` guarantee belongs to the write helpers below. Use
[`readSecureFile`](secure-file.md) when reading an externally managed
credential must also fail on broad permissions or unexpected ownership.

`readSecretFile()` and `tryReadSecretFile()` are asynchronous counterparts with
the same pinned-handle validation, byte cap, trimming, error codes, and strict
versus missing-is-undefined naming semantics.

Both readers reject known unsafe device and process-fd paths with `device-path`
before inspection, and check the resolved target before opening it. This includes
Windows reserved device names and ignored-space aliases such as `nul .txt`.
Optional readers propagate this error instead of treating the secret as missing.

Both sync and async readers compare lossless bigint identities from the preview,
opened descriptor, resolved target, and current input path before reading. POSIX
opens are nonblocking, so a raced FIFO is rejected by descriptor type instead of
waiting for a writer. An
allowed symlink must still point to the opened file. On Windows, a zero device
or inode is unverified: that inspection is retried once without reopening the
file, preserving known identity components and link checks. Definite mismatches
and persistent ambiguity fail with `path-mismatch`; optional reads do not treat
these failures as missing files.

If an already validated descriptor fails while reading, both readers throw an
operational `FsSafeError` with `code: "read-failed"`; inspect `cause` for the
underlying Node filesystem code such as `EIO`.

Caught `null` or `undefined` inspection and read failures are reported as
structured errors with an `Error` cause carrying `"null"` or `"undefined"`,
instead of an internal `TypeError` while inspecting the thrown value.

A synchronous reader closes its descriptor once. A close failure preserves an
earlier read or identity-validation error; after a successful read, the close
failure is reported before trimming or rejecting empty content.

Use the async strict reader when a service cannot start safely without the
credential:

```ts
import { readSecretFile } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/secret";

const signingKey = await readSecretFile(
  "/var/lib/app/keys/webhook-signing.key",
  "webhook signing key",
  { maxBytes: 8 * 1024, rejectSymlink: true },
);
startWebhookVerifier(signingKey);
```

## Writing

### `writeSecretFileAtomic(params)`

Async. Creates the parent directory at `dirMode` (default `0o700`) if missing, writes content to a sibling temp file, finalizes `mode` (default `0o600`) through an owned descriptor after content writes, and atomically renames over the destination. Publication verification checks the final file identity and mode.

Both secret writers capture top-level parameter values when called, before
asynchronous filesystem preparation; a supplied byte buffer is captured by
reference. A parameter getter throwing `null` or `undefined` rejects with that
same value before filesystem inspection.

On POSIX, both native and JavaScript writers verify actual `0o600` permission
bits through the retained descriptor before writing content. A filesystem that
reports successful chmod without enforcing those bits fails with
`insecure-permissions` before any payload is written, including when an explicit
`dirMode` permits other users to traverse the parent. The requested final `mode`
is still applied after content writes, including restrictive and special-bit
overrides. This mode-bit check does not require native ACL inspection; JavaScript
secret writes remain available on macOS.

Concurrent writes to distinct leaves may share creation of a missing parent.
After a parent-creation race, the helper re-inspects the entry and requires a
non-symlink directory, then revalidates root/parent guards, containment, and
the requested directory mode before writing either leaf.

Publication verification borrows the writer's still-open descriptor to check
the exact file identity, regular-file and link policy, requested POSIX mode,
and root/parent ancestry before the writer closes it. All `0o7777` mode bits
must match, including explicitly requested special bits; unexpected special
bits are rejected. POSIX mode overrides such as `0o000` and `0o200` do not
require read permission or a readonly reopen, and verification does not widen
the final mode. Windows retains pathname-identity verification without enforcing
POSIX mode bits; its native writer checks the reopened descriptor against the
original lossless file identity before changing the final mode.

Failed JavaScript fallback writes attempt cleanup while retaining the original
descriptor and only after checking parent and file identities. Native cleanup
also compares lossless parent and file identities. Unverifiable paths are left
for caller-managed cleanup, and cleanup failures do not replace the original
write error. These are best-effort identity checks followed by name-based
removal, not atomic conditional unlink. A publication-verification failure
after a completed write does not authorize deleting the published file.

```ts
import { writeSecretFileAtomic } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/secret";

await writeSecretFileAtomic({
  rootDir: "/var/lib/app",
  filePath: "/var/lib/app/auth.token",
  content: token,
});
```

### Parameters

```ts
type WriteSecretFileParams = {
  rootDir: string;             // trusted root directory (created at dirMode if missing)
  filePath: string;             // absolute path; must be inside rootDir
  content: string | Uint8Array;
  mode?: number;                // file mode for the new file (default PRIVATE_SECRET_FILE_MODE = 0o600)
  dirMode?: number;             // mode for the root and intermediate dirs (default PRIVATE_SECRET_DIR_MODE = 0o700)
  durable?: boolean;            // default true; false skips file and parent fsync
};
```

`durable: false` preserves atomic publication, modes, and identity checks while
skipping file and parent-directory `fsync` calls. Use it only for reconstructible
data where lower latency matters more than crash-durability; private and JSON
stores forward their durability policy here.

The full POSIX directory mode is asserted on each component along the path: `rootDir`, then any intermediate dirs, then the parent. Existing directories, including another creator's `EEXIST` winner, must already match `dirMode` exactly or the write fails with `insecure-permissions`; they are never chmod-repaired. An explicitly requested directory mode such as `0o2750` preserves its setgid bit. Audit and adjust existing secret directories yourself. The admitted directory guards are retained through traversal and the final writer/lock handoff; a fresh pathname lookup cannot silently authorize a replacement. The caller must still trust the selected root and its owners; matching permission bits alone do not establish that trust.

Directory admission and its retained guards use lossless bigint identities, including through private locks and native writes. On Windows, an unknown zero device or inode gets one reinspection that retains known components; a definite mismatch or persistent ambiguity fails with `path-mismatch` rather than authorizing a replacement.

Both mode options must resolve to integers between `0o0000` and `0o7777`; invalid values fail with `invalid-path` before directory creation or file publication. Windows validates the options but does not enforce POSIX permission bits.

After this operation wins directory creation, initialization uses a pinned descriptor bound to the admitted identity and effective user, with ancestor checks before chmod. It does not chmod the caller's pathname. Creation and descriptor admission are separate operations, not an atomic create-and-pin guarantee. A raced directory that has not reached its requested mode yet is rejected rather than repaired; callers may retry after its creator finishes initialization.

If initial directory-descriptor admission fails, its original identity, ownership,
or inspection error is preserved even when closing the rejected descriptor fails.
Close failures after successful admission remain reportable.

Initialization fails closed if the platform cannot safely pin a created directory. In particular, a non-root macOS process cannot pin a new `000` directory produced by `umask(0o777)`; the write fails without repairing that directory or writing a secret. Restrictive masks retaining owner search permission remain usable. Linux x64/arm64 can use the guarded `O_PATH`/procfs descriptor route where available. There is no unguarded pathname-chmod fallback, and a failure may leave a created directory for caller-managed cleanup.

### `createSecretFileAtomic(params)`

This create-only sibling has the same directory, mode, pinned-write, and
post-write verification policy. Final materialization uses exclusive create;
if anything already occupies the target path it throws
`FsSafeError("secret-exists")` without modifying that entry. Use the distinct
name when first-writer-wins is part of the credential protocol.

Its `durable` option also accepts `"file"`, matching `Root.create()`. This
requires every file `fsync` to succeed, including on `EPERM`, while parent-directory
synchronization remains best effort. The default and boolean options retain their
existing behavior. `writeSecretFileAtomic()` continues to accept boolean durability.

Strict file synchronization preserves the existing publication strategy and
identity-checked cleanup. A failed file flush before staged publication prevents
publication; a failure after publication can leave the complete file present.

Distinct leaves can share missing-parent creation without a `secret-exists`
error. Concurrent creates at the same leaf still have exactly one winner;
the loser receives `secret-exists` and leaves the winner's bytes intact.

For example, two onboarding requests may race to install the first refresh
token. Exactly one should win, and the loser must not overwrite it:

```ts
import { FsSafeError } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/errors";
import { createSecretFileAtomic } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/secret";

try {
  await createSecretFileAtomic({
    rootDir: "/var/lib/app/credentials",
    filePath: "/var/lib/app/credentials/provider.refresh-token",
    content: refreshToken,
    durable: "file",
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (!(error instanceof FsSafeError) || error.code !== "secret-exists") throw error;
  // Another initializer won. Read and validate the installed credential.
}
```

For more permissive credentials, override `mode`:

```ts
await writeSecretFileAtomic({
  rootDir: "/var/lib/app",
  filePath: "/var/lib/app/readonly.token",
  content: token,
  mode: 0o400, // tighter than the default
});
```

## Common patterns

### Load on boot, reauthenticate on miss

```ts
const token = tryReadSecretFileSync("/var/lib/app/auth.token", "auth token");
if (!token) await runOauthFlow();
```

### Refresh and persist a token

```ts
const fresh = await refreshToken(currentRefresh);
await writeSecretFileAtomic({
  rootDir: "/var/lib/app",
  filePath: "/var/lib/app/auth.token",
  content: JSON.stringify(fresh),
});
```

### Compose with `withTimeout`

```ts
import { withTimeout } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/advanced";

await withTimeout(
  writeSecretFileAtomic({ rootDir, filePath, content }),
  5_000,
  "persist auth token",
);
```

## Threat model notes

- On POSIX, the default `0600` file and `0700` directory modes restrict group and other access. They do not protect against processes with the same UID, root, attackers who can read process memory, or access granted by additional ACL entries.
- Validation failures are tripwires, not authorization. Investigate before clearing a rejected credential file.
- On POSIX, a file that still reports a mode other than `0600` after initialization is rejected with `insecure-permissions` before payload is written. Matching mode reports alone cannot prove that an arbitrary filesystem actually enforces those permissions.
