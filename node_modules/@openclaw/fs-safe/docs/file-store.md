# File store

`fileStore` is exported from `@openclaw/fs-safe/store`. It is a managed wrapper around `root()` for the common "store files under a directory at known modes, prune old ones, hand back absolute paths" pattern. Useful for caches, ingest staging, generated artifacts, anywhere the consumer wants object-style access plus stream and copy primitives.

```ts
import {
  fileStore,
  type FileStore,
  type FileStoreOptions,
  type FileStoreWriteOptions,
  type FileStorePruneOptions,
} from "@openclaw/fs-safe/store";
```

## When to reach for it

- You want a single directory holding files written by your code, with consistent mode bits and atomic placement.
- You want a `FileStore.write(rel, data)` / `read(rel)` / `pruneExpired(...)` interface.
- You want to feed a stream into the store with a byte cap.
- You don't need the full `Root` surface (move, list, mkdir, …); the store can hand you a real `Root` via `.root()` when you do.

## Factory: `fileStore(options)`

```ts
const cache = fileStore({
  rootDir: "/var/cache/app",
  mode: 0o600,        // file mode for writes (default 0o600)
  dirMode: 0o700,     // mode for parent directories created on demand (default 0o700)
  maxBytes: 64 * 1024 * 1024, // optional: refuse writes/reads larger than this
  private: true,      // use secret-file atomic writes for private state
  durable: true,      // sync file and parent directory (default true)
});
```

| `FileStoreOptions` option | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `rootDir` | Required | Store directory. |
| `private` | `false` | Use the secret-file atomic path. |
| `mode` / `dirMode` | `0o600` / `0o700` | File and parent-directory modes. |
| `maxBytes` | Unset | Store read/write byte limit. |
| `durable` | `true` | Sync the written file and its parent directory; see method support below. |

Store and per-call `maxBytes` values must be non-negative safe integers or positive `Infinity`. Zero is an active zero-byte cap; `Infinity` disables the cap. An omitted or explicitly `undefined` per-call value preserves the store-level limit. The same rule applies to buffer writes, streams, copies, async reads, and synchronous reads/writes.

Use `private: true` for credentials, auth profiles, tokens, and other private
state. Private mode keeps the same `FileStore` shape but routes writes through
the secret-file atomic path, refusing symlink parent components and re-asserting
mode after rename.

Returns a `FileStore`:

```ts
type FileStore = {
  readonly rootDir: string;
  path(relativePath: string): string;
  root(): Promise<Root>;
  write(rel, data: string | Uint8Array, options?): Promise<string>;
  writeStream(rel, stream: Readable, options?): Promise<string>;
  copyIn(rel, sourcePath: string, options?): Promise<string>;
  open(rel, options?): Promise<OpenResult>;
  read(rel, options?): Promise<ReadResult>;
  readBytes(rel, options?): Promise<Buffer>;
  readText(rel, options?): Promise<string>;
  readTextIfExists(rel, options?): Promise<string | null>;
  readJson<T = unknown>(rel, options?): Promise<T>;
  readJsonIfExists<T = unknown>(rel, options?): Promise<T | null>;
  writeText(rel, data: string | Uint8Array, options?): Promise<string>;
  writeJson(rel, data: unknown, options?): Promise<string>;
  json<T = unknown>(rel, options?): JsonStore<T>;
  remove(rel): Promise<void>;
  exists(rel): Promise<boolean>;
  pruneExpired(options: FileStorePruneOptions): Promise<void>;
};
```

`path()` returns the absolute path the store would use, after asserting it stays inside `rootDir`. Useful for logging or for handing to other libraries.

Every `relativePath` is a portable store key. The same lexical policy applies
to every keyed async and sync method, including reads, `exists`, `remove`,
`path()`, and `json()` construction, with either `private: false` or `true`.
Keys must use their exact canonical spelling; the store never trims, normalizes,
or converts one caller-supplied key onto another:

- Keys are nonempty NFC Unicode strings without surrounding whitespace or NUL.
- Segments are separated by a single forward slash. Empty segments, repeated or
  trailing slashes, and complete `.` or `..` segments are rejected, including
  `./b`, `a/./b`, and `a/../b`.
- Every backslash is rejected on every platform, including a literal POSIX
  `a\b` filename. POSIX and Windows absolute, rooted, UNC, and extended paths
  are rejected.
- Windows drive-relative segments such as `C:name` or `C:` are rejected
  anywhere in a key, including `a/C:name`.
- On Windows, every other colon is rejected too, preventing a key from naming
  an NTFS alternate stream or directory-index alias. POSIX keeps accepting
  ordinary colon-bearing segments that are not drive-relative spellings.
- No segment may end in an ASCII dot or space.

Violations report `invalid-path` when key validation is reached. Ordinary nested
keys, NFC Unicode such as `café/日本語.txt`, `.hidden`, `a..b`, and internal spaces
such as `internal space/a b.txt` are accepted. On POSIX, colons elsewhere, such
as the timestamp in `logs/2026-08-02T10:30:00Z.log`, remain lexically valid;
Windows rejects that spelling as stream syntax.

Keys such as `~` and `~/state.json` name literal entries inside the store; they
do not expand the user's home directory. Reads, writes, removal, and pruning
all use that literal identity. The `Root` returned by `root()` retains its own
home-expansion behavior.

Validation retains each method's operation order. Async reads, `exists`, and
`remove` open the root first: if the root is missing, strict methods report
`not-found` and `readTextIfExists` / `readJsonIfExists` return `null`, even for an
invalid key. With an existing root, those same invalid keys report `invalid-path`.
Private `copyIn` checks and reads its source before validating the destination
key, and `writeJson` serializes its value before validating the key. Key rejection
therefore does not imply that no filesystem access or serialization occurred.

`root()` returns a [`Root`](root.md) handle for the same directory when you need the full surface (move, list, mkdir). It's a fresh handle per call and is safe to call frequently.

## Writes

Writes use guarded sibling-temp publication: apply file and directory modes,
then rename into place. By default, the file and parent directory are synced
where supported by the platform and writer.

`durable: false` keeps the sibling-temp replace/rename behavior but skips the
temp-file and parent-directory `fsync` calls. Use it only for reconstructible
metadata where lower latency matters more than crash-durability. Per-call
`durable` overrides the store option, which defaults to `true`; an omitted or
`undefined` override preserves the store default. Modes, path confinement,
and publication identity checks are unchanged.

Synchronous writes retain their original write-only descriptor through rename
and publication checks, using exact bigint file identities. When Windows cannot
report a pathname's identity, verification reopens the name only to compare its
descriptor with the retained writer; it never reads file contents. A substituted
file is rejected even if its bytes match, and a post-publication failure leaves
the published entry intact for caller-owned recovery. Ordinary write-only and
mode-000 outputs do not require a readable descriptor when pathname metadata is
available.

If a synchronous write operation and its final temp-descriptor close both fail,
the store reports them in operation-then-close order in an `AggregateError`.
This ordering and the original JavaScript thrown value are preserved even when
that value is `undefined` or otherwise falsy. An unsuccessful best-effort temp
unlink remains registered for identity-checked process-exit cleanup; it does not
prevent the close attempt or replace either reportable failure.

If an opaque pathname cannot be reopened because of an ACL denial or sharing
restriction, the synchronous writer intentionally rejects with `path-mismatch`:
its exact publication identity cannot be verified. There is no equal-content
fallback. The published entry remains present, so callers must inspect or
recover that outcome instead of assuming the write did not occur.

Synchronous directory creation retains exact bigint receipts for the store root
and every parent component. On POSIX, an existing or newly created directory
whose complete requested mode differs is reopened without following the final
name, checked against its receipt and parent chain, and finalized through that
descriptor. A concurrent root or parent replacement is rejected without
applying the mode to the replacement. Directories already at the requested mode
skip the descriptor and mode operation. Windows retains its bounded `mkdir`
mode request and identity checks without relying on directory descriptors or a
pathname `chmod`, because Node does not enforce POSIX directory modes there.

Node does not expose a portable, `fchmod`-capable search-only directory
descriptor on Linux. If a mismatched existing directory, or one created under
an owner-read-removing umask, cannot be opened for reading, the synchronous
store therefore fails closed with `permission-unverified`; it never falls back
to pathname `chmod`. On supported macOS x64/arm64 hosts it also tries an
`O_SEARCH` descriptor, so owner-searchable directories can still be repaired.
Directories with neither usable read nor search access remain fail-closed.

| Method | Durability support |
|---|---|
| `write`, `writeText`, `writeJson` (async and sync) | Per-call option overrides store default. |
| `writeStream`, `copyIn` (either private mode) | Per-call option overrides store default. |
| JSON `write`, `update`, `updateOr` | JSON handle option overrides file-store default. |

### `write(rel, data, options?)`

```ts
const path = await cache.write("entries/2026/05/05.json", JSON.stringify(entry));
```

Buffer or string. Returns the final absolute path. Throws `too-large` if `data.byteLength` exceeds `maxBytes`.

### `writeText(rel, data, options?)` / `writeJson(rel, data, options?)`

Convenience wrappers over `write`. `writeJson` pretty-prints with a trailing newline by default and accepts `{ trailingNewline: false }` when the exact bytes matter.

### `json<T>(rel, options?)`

Returns a typed single-file JSON state helper for a file under this store. It
inherits the store's root, mode, max-size, durability, and private-write policy, then adds
`readOr`, `readRequired`, `update`, `updateOr`, and optional sidecar locking:

```ts
const state = cache.json<State>("state/settings.json", { lock: true });
await state.updateOr(defaultState, (current) => ({ ...current, enabled: true }));
```

Use this when one JSON file owns one piece of state. `jsonStore({ filePath })`
is the absolute-path convenience wrapper for the same primitive.

Pass `{ durable: false }` or `{ durable: true }` to `json()` to override the
parent store's durability for all mutations of that JSON handle.

### `writeStream(rel, stream, options?)`

```ts
import { Readable } from "node:stream";
const path = await cache.writeStream("downloads/blob.bin", Readable.from(remoteFetch));
```

Streams into a sibling temp with a running byte budget. Aborts the source stream with `too-large` if `maxBytes` is exceeded mid-stream — partial writes are cleaned up.

Streams honor `durable` in both private modes. Non-private streams stage their
input and forward the resolved durability option to Root `copyIn` for publication.

### `copyIn(rel, sourcePath, options?)`

```ts
const path = await cache.copyIn("ingest/upload.bin", "/tmp/upload.bin");
```

One-shot ingest from an absolute source path. Source is checked for symlink/non-regular before copy. Same mode rules as `write`.

`copyIn` honors per-call and store-level `durable` values in both private modes,
with the same precedence as `write`.

### `FileStoreWriteOptions`

Per-call overrides for the store-level defaults:

Writes capture byte limits, modes, and durability before asynchronous work or
stream consumption. JSON writes capture those fields and the trailing-newline
setting before serialization. Later mutation cannot change those captured values.
Accessors run on the original options object. Ordinary writes retain content
conversion and byte-limit validation before reading modes and durability.
The legacy non-private stream `tempPrefix` accessor still runs after staging;
it does not control the publication policy.

```ts
type FileStoreWriteOptions = {
  durable?: boolean;   // store default, otherwise true
  dirMode?: number;
  mode?: number;
  maxBytes?: number;
  tempPrefix?: string;  // override the default "." + basename
};
```

| `FileStoreWriteOptions` option | Default |
|---|---|
| `durable` | Store option, otherwise `true`. |
| `dirMode` / `mode` | Store directory/file modes. |
| `maxBytes` | Store byte limit. |
| `tempPrefix` | Writer-specific temporary prefix. |

The same durability precedence applies to `fileStoreSync().write`,
`writeText`, and `writeJson`. The synchronous store has no `writeStream` or
`copyIn` methods.

## Reads

`open`, `read`, `readBytes`, `readText`, and `readJson` delegate to a fresh `Root` with `hardlinks: "reject"` and the store's `maxBytes`. Same return shapes as `Root`.
Async and sync reads both report `not-file` when the key names a directory;
stable hardlinks and symlinks retain `hardlink` and `symlink`. The `IfExists`
methods return their nullish result only for `not-found`. Operational filesystem
read failures use `read-failed` with the Node error retained in `cause`.

## `remove(rel)` / `exists(rel)`

Forward to the underlying `Root`. `remove` unlinks files and `rmdir`s empty directories; non-empty dirs throw `not-empty`.

## `pruneExpired(options)`

Walk the store and delete files older than `options.ttlMs`:

```ts
await cache.pruneExpired({
  ttlMs: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days
  recursive: true,
  pruneEmptyDirs: true,
});
```

Options:

```ts
type FileStorePruneOptions = {
  ttlMs: number;
  recursive?: boolean;       // default false (top-level only)
  maxDepth?: number;         // bound recursion explicitly
  pruneEmptyDirs?: boolean;  // also remove dirs that became empty (only with recursive/maxDepth)
};
```

Symlinks are skipped. The walk is best-effort — failures on individual entries don't abort the whole prune. Compares against `mtimeMs`.

Pruning rechecks that a selected entry is still a regular file and still expired
immediately before guarded removal. Fresh replacements and in-place timestamp
refreshes are preserved; replacements that are themselves expired remain
eligible. This does not require read permission. The existing best-effort
external-process race window after dispatch still applies.

Empty-directory pruning likewise rechecks that the selected entry is still a
directory immediately before guarded removal. File and symlink replacements
are preserved, and a directory that becomes nonempty is left in place.

## Difference from `Root`

| `FileStore` | `Root` |
|---|---|
| Object-style with mode+dirMode baked in. | Method-style boundary; mode is per-call or per-default. |
| `writeStream` with built-in byte budget. | Manual via `openWritable()`. |
| `writeText` / `writeJson` return the final absolute path. | `Root.write` / `writeJson` return void. |
| `copyIn` returns the final absolute path. | `Root.copyIn` returns void. |
| `pruneExpired` walks by `mtime`. | No prune helper. |
| Reads delegate via `Root` internally. | The boundary itself. |

If you need richer ops (move, list, append, mkdir), call `store.root()` to get a `Root` and use that.

`FileStore` owns portable key identity; `Root` owns filesystem confinement.
Existing-object Root lookups intentionally retain broader confined path
compatibility, including in-root absolute paths and parent-segment spellings,
and literal backslashes on POSIX. FileStore rejects those spellings even when
Root could resolve them safely inside the directory. This key policy does not
change Root's containment checks or the absolute-path `jsonStore({ filePath })`
contract.

## Common patterns

### Cache with TTL prune

```ts
const cache = fileStore({ rootDir: "/var/cache/app", maxBytes: 16 * 1024 * 1024 });

await cache.writeStream(`${id}.bin`, fetchStream(id));

// Background prune every hour
setInterval(() => cache.pruneExpired({ ttlMs: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 }), 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

### Ingest pipeline

```ts
const ingest = fileStore({ rootDir: "/srv/ingest", mode: 0o644 });

for (const upload of uploads) {
  const dest = await ingest.copyIn(`raw/${upload.id}`, upload.tempPath, {
    maxBytes: 200 * 1024 * 1024,
  });
  await enqueueProcess(dest);
}
```

### Drop down to `Root` for moves

```ts
const root = await store.root();
await root.move(`pending/${id}`, `done/${id}`);
```
