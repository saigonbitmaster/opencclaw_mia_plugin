# Local roots

The local-roots helpers accept a file path plus a list of trusted absolute
directories and return the first canonical root that contains the file. Use
them when configuration may name one of several approved media, cache, or
workspace roots.

```ts
import {
  readLocalFileFromRoots,
  resolveLocalPathFromRootsSync,
} from "@openclaw/fs-safe/advanced";
```

## Input shape

Both helpers take one options object. `filePath` may be absolute, home-relative,
relative to the current working directory, or a local `file://` URL. Relative
inputs are resolved exactly as Node resolves them; they are not searched as a
basename under each root.

```ts
type LocalRootsInputOptions = {
  filePath: string;
  roots: readonly string[]; // trusted absolute paths, checked in order
  label?: string;           // used in validation errors
};
```

Roots may use `~` or local `file://` spellings, but each resolved root must be
absolute. Existing root symlinks are canonicalized before containment is
checked. Invalid root entries throw `FsSafeError("invalid-path")`; an invalid
`file://` input throws `Error`. A path that is valid but does not fall inside
any usable root returns `null`.

## `resolveLocalPathFromRootsSync(options)`

```ts
type ResolveLocalPathFromRootsSyncOptions = LocalRootsInputOptions & {
  allowMissing?: boolean; // default false
  requireFile?: boolean;  // default false
};

type LocalRootsPathResult = {
  path: string; // canonical candidate path
  root: string; // canonical containing root
};
```

For an existing upload:

```ts
import { resolveLocalPathFromRootsSync } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/advanced";

const r = resolveLocalPathFromRootsSync({
  filePath: "/srv/uploads/photo.jpg",
  roots: ["/srv/uploads", "/srv/cache"],
  requireFile: true,
});

if (!r) throw new Error("photo is outside the configured roots");
console.log(r.path); // canonical path to photo.jpg
console.log(r.root); // canonical /srv/uploads
```

By default the candidate must exist. `allowMissing: true` instead canonicalizes
the nearest existing ancestor and validates the missing tail, which is useful
when selecting a future output location. `requireFile: true` rejects existing
directories and other non-file leaves. A missing suffix begins only at a
component that does not exist: dangling symlinks, descendants of dangling
symlinks, and candidates whose existing ancestors cannot be canonicalized are
rejected rather than treated as safe missing paths.

Filesystem path inputs retain symlinks and parent components until boundary
resolution, including after home expansion. A followed `link/../file` resolves
the parent of the link's target; default reads reject the link instead of
normalizing it away. File URLs retain the URL parser's normal path semantics.
An existing non-directory component cannot be traversed further, including by
`..`; the helpers reject that input instead of selecting a different file.

## `readLocalFileFromRoots(options)`

The asynchronous helper opens the candidate through the matched [`Root`](root.md),
so no-follow, identity, hardlink, device-path, and byte-limit checks happen at
the read itself.
Link policies are captured once before root initialization and reused for every
candidate, so replacing options while a read is pending cannot weaken admission.

```ts
type ReadLocalFileFromRootsOptions = LocalRootsInputOptions & {
  hardlinks?: "reject" | "allow";
  maxBytes?: number;
  nonBlockingRead?: boolean;
  symlinks?: "reject" | "follow-within-root" | "follow-parents-within-root";
};

type LocalRootsReadResult = ReadResult & {
  root: string; // canonical containing root
};
```

```ts
const r = await readLocalFileFromRoots({
  filePath: "/srv/uploads/photo.jpg",
  roots: ["/srv/uploads", "/srv/cache"],
  maxBytes: 8 * 1024 * 1024,
});
if (!r) throw new Error("photo is missing, unreadable, or outside the roots");
process.stdout.write(r.buffer);
```

The helper returns `null` when no configured root can be opened or no safe read
succeeds. This intentionally collapses missing, outside-root, and per-root read
failures; use a single `Root` directly when the caller must distinguish those
outcomes. Omitting `maxBytes` preserves `Root`'s 16 MiB default.

## File URL and Windows-path companions

The advanced surface also exports the normalization helpers used around this
API:

```ts
import {
  assertNoWindowsNetworkPath,
  basenameFromMediaSource,
  hasEncodedFileUrlSeparator,
  isWindowsDriveLetterPath,
  isWindowsNetworkPath,
  safeFileURLToPath,
  trySafeFileURLToPath,
} from "@openclaw/fs-safe/advanced";
```

- `safeFileURLToPath(fileUrl)` parses a local file URL and refuses remote hosts
  or paths that decode to Windows network paths.
- `trySafeFileURLToPath(fileUrl)` returns `undefined` instead of throwing.
- `isWindowsDriveLetterPath()` and `isWindowsNetworkPath()` classify Windows
  absolute and network spellings.
- `assertNoWindowsNetworkPath()` throws for a network path on Windows.
- `basenameFromMediaSource()` extracts a best-effort filename from a URL, data
  URI, or path.
- `hasEncodedFileUrlSeparator()` detects percent-encoded slash or backslash
  spellings.
