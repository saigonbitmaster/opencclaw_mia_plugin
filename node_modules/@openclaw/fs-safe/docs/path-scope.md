# pathScope()

`pathScope()` prepares absolute paths and returns plain `{ ok, path }` results. `resolve()` and `resolveAll()` check lexical containment without touching the filesystem; `existing()`, `files()`, and `writable()` add the filesystem checks described below. Use it to prepare paths before handing them to another library, whose file-opening and mutation behavior still applies.

```ts
import { pathScope } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/advanced";

const uploads = pathScope("/srv/uploads", { label: "uploads directory" });

const photo = uploads.resolve("user/photo.jpg");
if (!photo.ok) throw new Error(photo.error);

await sharp(photo.path).resize(800).toFile(/* … */);
```

## When to reach for it

`root()` is the right answer when you want method-style I/O (`fs.write`, `fs.readText`). `pathScope()` is the right answer when:

- You're handing absolute paths to **other libraries** that take absolute path strings (Sharp, FFmpeg, `tar`, native modules) and just want the boundary check up front.
- You want to validate user-supplied paths in bulk and return a typed `Result` rather than catching exceptions.
- You want the scope's `label` to appear in the error message: `"Invalid path: must stay within uploads directory"`.

## Signature

```ts
import type { FsSafeError } from "@openclaw/fs-safe/errors";

function pathScope(rootDir: string, options: PathScopeOptions): PathScope;

type PathScopeOptions = {
  label: string;          // appears in error messages
};

type PathScopeResolveOptions = {
  defaultName?: string;   // used when the requested path is empty
};

type PathResult = { ok: true; path: string } | { ok: false; error: string };
type PathsResult = { ok: true; paths: string[] } | { ok: false; error: string };
// Illustrative result alias, not a named package export.
type DirectoryResult =
  | { ok: true; path: string }
  | { ok: false; error: string; diagnostic?: FsSafeError };

type PathScope = {
  rootDir: string;
  label: string;
  resolve(requestedPath: string, options?: PathScopeResolveOptions): PathResult;
  resolveAll(requestedPaths: string[]): PathsResult;
  existing(requestedPaths: string[]): Promise<PathsResult>;
  files(requestedPaths: string[]): Promise<PathsResult>;
  writable(requestedPath: string, options?: PathScopeResolveOptions): Promise<PathResult>;
  ensureDir(requestedPath: string, options?: PathScopeResolveOptions & { mode?: number }): Promise<DirectoryResult>;
};
```

## Methods

### `resolve(rel, options?)`

Synchronous, lexical only — no filesystem touch. Resolves the relative path against `rootDir` and verifies the result stays inside the scope. Use when you only need the path string:

```ts
const r = uploads.resolve("user/photo.jpg");
if (!r.ok) return reply(400, r.error);
console.log(r.path); // /srv/uploads/user/photo.jpg
```

If the requested path is empty, `defaultName` (when set) is used.

### `resolveAll(rels)`

Synchronous bulk resolve. Returns `{ ok: true, paths }` if every input is in scope, or `{ ok: false, error }` on the first failure.

### `existing(rels)`

Async. Like `resolveAll`, but additionally allows trusted absolute paths whose `realpath` is inside the scope. Useful when callers pass either a relative path or an absolute path you've already validated.

### `files(rels)`

Async. Strict variant: every input must already exist as a regular file inside the scope, with `nlink === 1`. Symlinked entries are rejected.

### `writable(rel, options?)`

Async. Resolves a writable target: requires the parent directory to already
exist canonically inside the scope, refuses targets whose existing inode is a
symlink or hardlinked, and returns the absolute path to use for the write. Use
`ensureDir()` first when the parent needs to be created.

```ts
const t = await uploads.writable("reports/2026/05/report.pdf");
if (!t.ok) return reply(400, t.error);
await fs.writeFile(t.path, body);
```

### `ensureDir(rel, options?)`

Async. `mkdir -p` inside the scope. Walks each segment, refuses any symlink in the path, creates missing directories. Optional `mode` sets the directory mode.

Failures remain nonthrowing results with `error: string`. Policy rejections
(including traversal, NUL input, symlinks and non-directory segments) omit
`diagnostic`. Operational failures from `lstat`, `realpath` or `mkdir` include
an `FsSafeError` with `code: "helper-failed"`, `category: "operational"`, and
the exact original error in `cause`, including its native `code`, `errno` and
`syscall` when available. Only `ensureDir()` adds this diagnostic; other scope
methods retain their existing result shapes.

`error` equals `diagnostic.message` for operational failures, for example
`"Could not prepare uploads directory: ENAMETOOLONG during lstat"`. Display
text bounds and escapes the label and native code/syscall, without copying
the requested path or native error message. Treat the raw cause as sensitive
local diagnostic data, not as text to return to an untrusted caller. A failure
can leave already-created parent directories; it does not roll them back or
retry through an unchecked filesystem path.

```ts
const dir = await uploads.ensureDir("inbox", { mode: 0o755 });
if (!dir.ok) {
  // Pass the cause only to an appropriately restricted local diagnostic sink.
  if (dir.diagnostic) recordLocalFailure(dir.diagnostic.cause);
  return reply(dir.diagnostic ? 500 : 400, dir.error);
}
```

## Result type vs throwing

`pathScope` returns `{ ok: true, path }` / `{ ok: false, error }` instead of throwing. This makes it pleasant to use at validation boundaries:

```ts
function handle(req: Req, res: Res) {
  const r = uploads.resolve(req.body.path);
  if (!r.ok) return res.status(400).json({ error: r.error });
  return doWork(r.path);
}
```

For exception-flavored APIs, use `root()` instead — it throws `FsSafeError` with a typed `code`.

## Combine with `root()`

A common pattern at the edge of an HTTP handler: validate the input with `pathScope`, do the I/O with `root()`:

```ts
const uploads = pathScope("/srv/uploads", { label: "uploads" });
const fs = await root("/srv/uploads", { hardlinks: "reject" });

const r = uploads.resolve(req.body.path);
if (!r.ok) return reply(400, r.error);
const rel = path.relative(fs.rootReal, r.path);

const text = await fs.readText(rel);
```
