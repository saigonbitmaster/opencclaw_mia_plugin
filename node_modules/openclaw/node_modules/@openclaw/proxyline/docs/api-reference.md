# API Reference

Every public export, with the exact shape from `src/index.ts`, `src/connect.ts`, `src/node-http.ts`, and `src/proxy-socket.ts`.

## Functions

### `installProxyline(options): ProxylineHandle`

Aliased as `installGlobalProxy`. Installs the runtime and returns a handle.

- Throws `ProxylineError` with code `MANAGED_PROXY_URL_REQUIRED` if `mode: "managed"` is used without a `proxyUrl`.
- Throws `ProxylineError` with code `UNSUPPORTED_PROXY_PROTOCOL` if managed-mode `proxyUrl` is not `http://` or `https://`.
- Throws `ProxylineError` with code `RUNTIME_ALREADY_ACTIVE` if another Proxyline runtime is already installed and `ifActive` is omitted or cannot safely reuse the active runtime.

In managed mode (and active ambient mode), `installProxyline`:

- Captures originals for `http.request`, `http.get`, `http.globalAgent`, `https.request`, `https.get`, `https.globalAgent`.
- Captures the current undici global dispatcher and fetch globals.
- Installs patched `http.request`/`get`, `https.request`/`get`.
- Replaces `http.globalAgent` and `https.globalAgent` with Proxyline's HTTP/HTTPS Node agent.
- Calls `undici.setGlobalDispatcher` with a `ProxyAgent` (managed) or Proxyline's ambient dispatcher (ambient), and patches `globalThis.fetch` plus `Request`, `Response`, `Headers`, and `FormData` to use that dispatcher-compatible fetch stack.
- Emits `runtime.installed`.

In inactive ambient mode (no supported proxy env variables), no patches are installed; the handle returns a passive observer with `active: false`.

### `openProxyConnectTunnel(options): Promise<net.Socket | tls.TLSSocket>`

Opens a one-shot HTTP CONNECT tunnel through a proxy. See [Surfaces — HTTP CONNECT tunnel](./surfaces.md#http-connect-tunnel).

### `hasAmbientNodeProxyConfigured(options?): boolean`

Returns `true` when the ambient proxy environment would proxy a probe URL for the requested protocol. Defaults to `protocol: "https"`.

```ts
hasAmbientNodeProxyConfigured({ protocol: "https" });
```

### `createAmbientNodeProxyAgent(options?): http.Agent | undefined`

Returns a Proxyline-backed Node agent when ambient env proxy settings apply, or `undefined` when no proxy is configured for the requested protocol. This is for libraries that accept a Node `agent` option but should stay direct when the operator has no proxy env configured.

```ts
const agent = createAmbientNodeProxyAgent({
  protocol: "https",
  proxyTls: { caFile: "/etc/proxy-ca.pem" },
});
```

Supply `resolveProxyConnectOptions` when the application has already approved a
proxy's DNS lookup or needs client certificates or an explicit TLS server name.
The resolver receives the selected proxy URL as a string. Its returned properties
are copied once per cached proxy URL and transport (HTTP-forward or CONNECT).
Keep referenced certificate and key buffers unchanged for the agent's lifetime.
Direct requests do not call the resolver. Treat the URL as sensitive when it
contains proxy credentials; use `redactProxyUrl` before logging it.

The resolver is synchronous: finish asynchronous policy checks and DNS planning
before making the request. Request cancellation still belongs to the Node
`ClientRequest`; destroy the request or agent to close pending connections.

### `redactProxyUrl(value: string | URL): string`

Strips userinfo, search, and fragment from a URL. Used internally to keep events and decisions free of credentials. Safe to use on log lines you build yourself.

```ts
redactProxyUrl("https://user:secret@proxy.example:8443/path?q=1#frag");
// → "https://proxy.example:8443/path"
```

### `resolveProxyTlsCa(options): string | undefined`

Resolves a `ProxylineTlsOptions` value to a PEM string by reading `caFile` from disk if needed. Returns `undefined` when no CA material is supplied. Exposed so callers can pre-resolve before passing values into their own TLS-using code.

## Classes

### `ProxylineError extends Error`

```ts
class ProxylineError extends Error {
  readonly code: string;
  readonly name: "ProxylineError";
}
```

Codes:

- `MANAGED_PROXY_URL_REQUIRED` — `mode: "managed"` was used without `proxyUrl`.
- `UNSUPPORTED_PROXY_PROTOCOL` — proxy URL scheme is not `http://` or `https://`.
- `RUNTIME_ALREADY_ACTIVE` — another Proxyline runtime is already installed.
- `CONNECT_FAILED` — `openProxyConnectTunnel` failed (bad response, timeout, header overrun, or socket error).
- `INVALID_CONNECT_TARGET` — `openProxyConnectTunnel` received an empty or unsafe target host, invalid bracket syntax, or an invalid target port.

## Types

### `ProxylineMode`

```ts
type ProxylineMode = "managed" | "ambient";
```

See [Modes](./modes.md).

### `ProxylineSurface`

```ts
type ProxylineSurface =
  | "node-http"
  | "node-https"
  | "undici"
  | "websocket"
  | "connect"
  | "unknown";
```

Used in `explain()` decisions and event payloads to identify which network surface a decision is for. Pass it via `explain(url, { surface })`.

### `ProxylineOptions`

```ts
type ProxylineOptions = Readonly<{
  mode: ProxylineMode;
  proxyUrl?: string | URL;
  proxyTls?: ProxylineTlsOptions;
  bypassPolicy?: ProxylineBypassPolicy;
  ifActive?: "error" | "reuse-compatible" | "replace";
  onEvent?: (event: ProxylineEvent) => void;
  undici?: ProxylineUndiciOptions;
}>;
```

- `mode` — required. `"managed"` or `"ambient"`.
- `proxyUrl` — required in managed mode, ignored in ambient mode. Managed-mode URLs must be `http://` or `https://`.
- `proxyTls` — CA trust scoped to the proxy endpoint. See [Proxy TLS](./proxy-tls.md).
- `bypassPolicy` — managed-mode escape hatch for trusted traffic that should go direct. Ignored in ambient mode.
- `ifActive` — process singleton behavior when Proxyline is already active. Defaults to `"error"`. `"reuse-compatible"` returns the active handle when mode/proxy/TLS/bypass/undici settings match; ambient mode also requires the captured proxy env snapshot to match. `"replace"` stops the active runtime before installing the new one.
- `onEvent` — callback fired with every `ProxylineEvent`.
- `undici` — default options for Proxyline-owned undici dispatchers.

### `ProxylineUndiciOptions`

```ts
type ProxylineUndiciOptions = Readonly<{
  allowH2?: boolean;
  bodyTimeout?: number;
  headersTimeout?: number;
  connect?: Readonly<{
    autoSelectFamily?: boolean;
    autoSelectFamilyAttemptTimeout?: number;
  }>;
}>;
```

These options apply to the global dispatcher installed by `installGlobalProxy()` and to dispatchers returned by `createUndiciDispatcher()`.

### `ProxylineTlsOptions`

```ts
type ProxylineTlsOptions = Readonly<{
  ca?: string;     // PEM string
  caFile?: string; // path read with fs.readFileSync(..., "utf8")
}>;
```

When both are provided, `ca` wins.

### `ProxylineDecision`

```ts
type ProxylineDecision = Readonly<{
  kind: "proxied" | "direct" | "blocked";
  reason: string;
  surface: ProxylineSurface;
  url: string;
  proxyUrl?: string; // redacted
}>;
```

Known `reason` values:

- `"managed-proxy-active"` — managed mode applied.
- `"managed-proxy-bypass-policy"` — managed mode was active, but `bypassPolicy` intentionally sent the URL direct.
- `"managed-proxy-unsupported-url-scheme"` — managed mode is active, but the URL scheme is not one Proxyline can proxy.
- `"ambient-proxy-active"` — ambient mode resolved a proxy from env.
- `"ambient-proxy-not-configured"` — ambient mode has no proxy env set, or the URL scheme is unsupported.
- `"no-proxy-match"` — the URL matched `NO_PROXY`.
- `"runtime-stopped"` — `explain()` was called after `stop()`.

`kind: "blocked"` is reserved for future explicit deny rules; the current implementation does not produce blocked decisions.

### `ProxylineBypassRequest`

```ts
type ProxylineBypassRequest = Readonly<{
  surface: ProxylineSurface;
  url: string;
}>;
```

### `ProxylineBypassPolicy`

```ts
type ProxylineBypassPolicy = (request: ProxylineBypassRequest) => boolean;
```

Return `true` to send that managed-mode request direct. Use this only for explicitly trusted destinations such as loopback control-plane endpoints.

### `ProxylineEvent`

```ts
type ProxylineEvent =
  | Readonly<{ type: "runtime.installed"; mode: ProxylineMode; active: boolean; proxyUrl?: string }>
  | Readonly<{ type: "runtime.stopped"; mode: ProxylineMode }>
  | Readonly<{ type: "decision"; decision: ProxylineDecision }>
  | Readonly<{ type: "warning"; code: string; message: string }>;
```

`decision` events fire from inside `explain()`. `runtime.installed` and `runtime.stopped` fire from `installProxyline` and `handle.stop()` respectively. `warning` is reserved for future runtime diagnostics.

### `ExplainOptions`

```ts
type ExplainOptions = Readonly<{
  surface?: ProxylineSurface;
}>;
```

### `ProxylineHandle`

```ts
type ProxylineHandle = Readonly<{
  mode: ProxylineMode;
  active: boolean;
  proxyUrl?: string;
  createNodeAgent: () => http.Agent;
  createUndiciDispatcher: () => Dispatcher;
  createWebSocketAgent: () => http.Agent;
  explain: (url: string | URL, options?: ExplainOptions) => ProxylineDecision;
  registerBypass: (registration: ProxylineBypassRegistration) => () => void;
  stop: () => void;
  withBypass: <T>(registration: ProxylineBypassRegistration, run: () => T) => T;
}>;
```

- `mode` — the mode this handle was installed with.
- `active` — `true` when the runtime is installed and forcing/respecting a proxy.
- `proxyUrl` — redacted proxy URL string when active.
- `createNodeAgent()` — proxy-aware `http.Agent` for ad-hoc node:http(s) use. Returns a direct agent when inactive or after `stop()`.
- `createUndiciDispatcher()` — proxy-aware undici `Dispatcher`. Returns a direct `UndiciAgent()` when ambient-inactive or after `stop()`.
- `createWebSocketAgent()` — same as `createNodeAgent()` but typed for WebSocket clients.
- `explain(url, options?)` — returns a `ProxylineDecision` and emits a `decision` event.
- `registerBypass({ url, surface? })` — managed-mode process-wide bypass. Returns an unregister callback. When `surface` is omitted, the bypass matches any surface for that exact URL.
- `stop()` — restores the captured Node HTTP(S) stack, undici dispatcher, and fetch globals, destroys Proxyline-owned runtime agents/dispatchers, emits `runtime.stopped`. Idempotent.
- `withBypass(registration, run)` — applies a bypass only to `run()` and async work created inside that callback.

### Dispatcher Detection

```ts
isProxylineDispatcher(dispatcher: unknown): boolean;
```

Returns `true` for Proxyline-owned managed and ambient undici dispatchers. Use this instead of constructor-name checks when integrating with code that also manages undici globals. Import from `@openclaw/proxyline/dispatcher-brand` when detection must not load Proxyline's full runtime.

### `OpenProxyConnectTunnelOptions`

```ts
type OpenProxyConnectTunnelOptions = Readonly<{
  proxyUrl: string | URL;
  proxyTls?: ProxylineTlsOptions;
  proxyConnect?: ProxyConnectOptions;
  targetHost: string;
  targetPort: number;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  signal?: AbortSignal;
}>;
```

- `proxyUrl` — `http://` or `https://`. Userinfo becomes a `Proxy-Authorization: Basic` header.
- `proxyTls` — CA trust for HTTPS proxies. See [Proxy TLS](./proxy-tls.md).
- `proxyConnect` — prepared connection controls for this proxy hop; see below.
- `targetHost` / `targetPort` — what to ask the proxy to connect to.
- `timeoutMs` — overall budget for the CONNECT handshake. Defaults to `30000` when omitted. Pass `0` for no timeout.
- `signal` — optional caller cancellation; aborting rejects the handshake and destroys its active proxy socket.

### `AmbientNodeProxyAgentOptions`

```ts
type AmbientNodeProxyAgentOptions = {
  env?: ProxyEnvSnapshot;
  protocol?: "http" | "https";
  proxyTls?: ProxylineTlsOptions;
  resolveProxyConnectOptions?: (proxyUrl: string) => ProxyConnectOptions;
};
```

- `env` — optional env snapshot. Defaults to reading process env.
- `protocol` — probe protocol, defaulting to `"https"`.
- `proxyTls` — CA trust for HTTPS proxy endpoints. See [Proxy TLS](./proxy-tls.md).
- `resolveProxyConnectOptions` — resolves prepared connection controls for each cached proxy child agent.

### `ProxyConnectOptions`

```ts
type ProxyConnectOptions = Readonly<
  Pick<net.TcpNetConnectOpts, "lookup"> &
  Pick<tls.ConnectionOptions,
    "ca" | "cert" | "key" | "passphrase" | "servername" | "rejectUnauthorized">
>;
```

- `lookup` resolves only the proxy hostname. It never resolves the destination
  named in a CONNECT request.
- TLS fields apply only to an HTTPS proxy. `ca` takes precedence over the
  existing `proxyTls.ca`/`caFile` default. Other TLS fields keep Node's defaults
  when omitted; destination TLS remains request-owned.
- The proxy URL always owns the socket host and port. Extra JavaScript properties
  such as `host`, `port`, `path`, `socket`, or `ALPNProtocols` are ignored.
  HTTPS proxy connections negotiate HTTP/1.1.
- No operation signal is cached in these options. Node request cancellation and
  `openProxyConnectTunnel`'s existing handshake signal keep their own lifetimes.
